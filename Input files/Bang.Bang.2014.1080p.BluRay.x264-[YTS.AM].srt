00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:07,554
What's wrong with this city?

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,894
Somewhere there are ashes
and somewhere smoke.

4
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,851
Why doesn't someone say something?

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,893
Why do we endure smoke quietly?

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,145
Now it's the limit of endurance.

7
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:22,823
Let's bring this
reckless act to an end.

8
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:25,367
Smoking at public
places is prohibited.

9
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,745
Violation will lead to penalty.

10
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:30,994
Don't smoke. Or let others smoke.

11
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,201
You will have to pay
a heavy price for smoking.

12
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:04,666
- Captain Nanda.

13
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,876
Jai Hind.
- Jai Hind.

14
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,674
This is Richard Parker, MI6.

15
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:09,130
You have a gift for my country.

16
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,930
Indeed.
- Please come.

17
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,887
How was he apprehended?

18
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,640
At Heathrow Airport,
carrying fake documents.

19
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:19,522
Omar Zafar,
India's most wanted criminal.

20
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,733
We've been looking
for him for many years.

21
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,443
What was he doing in London?

22
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,445
There's a private island
located near the Russian Coast.

23
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,238
We heard that he
was here to buy it.

24
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,735
There's never a recession in
the business of terrorism, right?

25
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:31,818
- Thank you, sir.

26
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:34,113
Yes, mom.

27
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:35,197
- Viren.

28
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,951
Yes, mom.

29
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,078
- Have you reached?

30
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:38,617
I'll call you back in a bit.

31
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,496
- Is everything okay?

32
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,998
Yeah, yeah all OK.

33
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,045
- Did you wear your sweater?

34
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,667
Yes, mom, I'm wearing my sweater.

35
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:44,873
- I'm sure you didn't.

36
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,583
How do you know
lam not wearing it?

37
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,045
- I know exactly
how the two of you are.

38
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,174
- Listen, Jai was saying that..

39
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,880
I'll call you back in a bit. Bye.

40
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,569
- Permission granted.

41
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,694
Good luck.
- Thanks.

42
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,717
- The Kohinoor diamond is ours!

43
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,340
- Bring back our Kohinoor!

44
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,047
- The Kohinoor diamond is ours!

45
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,382
- Bring back our Kohinoor!

46
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,471
- Permission granted.

47
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,551
- Oh...

48
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,180
Welcome, Colonel Nanda.

49
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,684
Your search for me
has been very intense.

50
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,563
I would've stood
up and saluted you.

51
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,941
But as you can see,
I'm having pizza...

52
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,322
...and I'm a little tired today.

53
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,533
Would you like a slice?

54
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,489
No.

55
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:01,829
You eat it.

56
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,833
Once you get to Tihar...

57
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,582
...your next pizza will be
on the day of your execution.

58
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,086
As your last wish..

59
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,257
...with extra cheese.

60
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,974
Wake up, Colonel.

61
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:25,353
This isn't your Delhi, it's London.

62
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,060
Tell me something...

63
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,570
How many criminals
have actually been..

64
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,363
...extradited to India from London?

65
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,737
None. Not even one.

66
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:39,947
A new extradition treaty
is being prepared as we speak.

67
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,995
According to which, any criminal...

68
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,127
...will be extradited to
his homeland within 72 hours..

69
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:47,955
...without an appeal.

70
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,418
Very soon you're going to
be begging for mercy...

71
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,720
...in an Indian court of law,
Omar Zafar.

72
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,973
And then... then what?

73
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:04,642
This for the public prosecutor.

74
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,270
This for the judge.

75
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,644
And this...
for the police and ministers.

76
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,526
Your country is starving,
Colonel...

77
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,858
...and it's full of corrupt people.

78
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:20,654
A country where everyone's
begging for something.

79
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:25,709
And your ministers
are always willing...

80
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:30,335
to forsake their integrity
and sell their souls.

81
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:32,749
So tell me...

82
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,719
what are you?

83
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:41,387
Are you corrupt like them or
just faithfully following orders?

84
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,723
Welcome to the Omar Zafar show.

85
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,818
- Permission granted.

86
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,824
Any last wish?

87
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:52,663
Maybe some pizza
with extra cheese, huh!

88
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,625
But you don't have 30 minutes.

89
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:01,134
Because the countdown
to your end has begun.

90
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,725
Those who serve their country...

91
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,270
start the countdown to their
death from their very first breath.

92
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,313
You must have taken
many lives, Zafar.

93
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,316
But take a good look in these eyes.

94
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,528
There is no grief...

95
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,367
or fear of death.

96
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,822
There's only pride.

97
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:34,622
Soon...you'll see your
death in similar eyes.

98
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,341
Your countdown will begin...

99
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,794
as soon as you
press the trigger.

100
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,259
10...

101
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,257
9...

102
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,716
8...

103
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,017
0!

104
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:09,244
Would you like to speak
to your mother for the last time?

105
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,706
- Hello Viren, I was saying that...

106
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,332
- Viren!

107
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,382
- Viren, what happened?

108
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:23,887
- Are you alright?

109
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,631
- Viren, are you alright?

110
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:26,923
- Viren!

111
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:28,717
- Viren!

112
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,428
- Viren I can't hear you, son.

113
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,350
- What's wrong?

114
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:34,806
- Hello...

115
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,483
- Hello. No one is saying anything.

116
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,185
- Viren!

117
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,567
- Viren, talk to me!

118
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,115
- Pankaj!

119
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,902
- Something has happened to Viren!

120
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,988
- Viren, talk to me my son.

121
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:52,866
- Viren!

122
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,957
- Talk to me!

123
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:02,959
- Viren!

124
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,703
Have you heard
about the new treaty?

125
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,155
I have.

126
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,455
- If this treaty is signed, our men..

127
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,211
Won't be safe anywhere.

128
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,046
It won't be signed.

129
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,168
An old wound,
which hasn't healed yet...

130
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,215
...we'll just have to revive it.

131
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,805
The Kohinoor!

132
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,098
Stealing the Kohinoor
is impossible.

133
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,804
Make it possible.

134
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,348
I want the Kohinoor!

135
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,059
And the thief should be an Indian.

136
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,070
In a population of 1.2 billion...

137
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,441
...there must be someone
who can do this job.

138
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,610
Find him.

139
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,127
- We now have official confirmation..

140
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,339
That the Kohinoor has just been
stolen from the Tower of London.

141
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,178
- How was it possible?

142
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:37,263
- The Kohinoor was stolen despite the
Tower of London's heavy security.

143
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,224
There are reports of a leak
in the Tower of London's security.

144
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,230
- But the MI6 is denying
any such rumors.

145
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,437
When the collection
was opened for inspection.

146
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,488
- They realized that only
the Kohinoor was missing.

147
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,363
- The footage from around 500
CCTV cameras is being inspected.

148
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,694
- This investigation will hopefully
clear up a few details of the theft.

149
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,654
- And now we would like to show you..

150
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,330
The amazing Kohinoor's
colourful history.

151
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:59,285
- It is believed that the Kohinoor
was discovered in Tamil Nadu..

152
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,620
- ..And was then owned by
rulers from the Delhi, Rajput..

153
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:04,957
- .. Mughal, Afsharid,
Durrani and Sikh dynasties.

154
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,916
- When the British ransacked India..

155
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,385
- .. And Queen Victoria was
declared the Empress of India.

156
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,133
- Against everyone's wishes..

157
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,762
- .. India's beloved Kohinoor was sent
all the way to Great Britain.

158
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:16,843
Sorry for the interruption.

159
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:20,851
There was one unidentified male
found in the Tower of London...

160
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,062
- There are neither
fingerprints nor images.

161
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,314
- This isn't the work of a common
thief but of a criminal mastermind.

162
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,233
- The thief is being touted
as the 'Hero of India'.

163
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,564
- So who is this man?

164
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,690
"Invisible Thief", "Kohinoor Thief"

165
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,571
- These are some of the names
people are calling him.

166
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,446
Who is this?

167
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,699
- Who will win this game
between the thief and the police?

168
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,622
- This century's biggest
robbery and there is no lead..

169
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,158
...but the entire world is..

170
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,710
- ..Waiting with bated breath
to get a look at the thief's face..

171
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,334
- Who managed to steal the
Kohinoor with great skill.

172
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,586
- Who is he? Where has he disappeared?
When will he be caught?

173
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,632
- The police search is on.

174
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,585
- But no one knows where he is.

175
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,832
Harleen!

176
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,758
Oh...you're bathing!

177
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,552
Grandma, go out.

178
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,182
Grandma, please go out.

179
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,341
Quiet.

180
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,719
I've seen you grow up.

181
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,055
I've bathed you,
changed your nappy.

182
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,357
Grandma,
I'm not a kid anymore. Go out!

183
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,935
That's what you think.

184
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,777
Don't miss the spot
behind your ears.

185
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:32,945
Grandma...

186
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,695
Listen, did you know that..

187
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,906
...someone has stolen the Kohinoor.

188
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,075
Please pass me the towel.

189
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,787
Jewel Thief!

190
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,460
It's hard to find such
youngsters these days.

191
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:51,089
Ashok Kumar, Dev Anand.

192
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,421
I just want to meet
a man like that..

193
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:59,006
...someone,
who steals diamonds and hearts.

194
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:04,144
"He has stolen my dream."

195
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,638
So then please go to his bathroom.

196
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,181
Hand me my towel.

197
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,987
The Kohinoor is India's property!

198
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,397
If someone returns
this jewel to India..

199
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:21,153
...then, he should be
honored with the 'Bharat Ratna'.

200
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:25,953
Bless his soul, whoever stole it!

201
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,909
Grandma, you're completely crazy.

202
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,999
I wish you were crazy too, like me.

203
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:33,415
You're so boring.
You're always alone.

204
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,050
While all the girls
your age have a boyfriend.

205
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,341
Grandma, I haven't found
the right guy yet, okay?

206
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,260
But why are you so choosy?

207
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:45,852
When I was your age,
I had at least 30 affairs.

208
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,100
Excessive quality
control isn't good.

209
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,561
I don't want to deal
with complications of love.

210
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,894
You don't know what love is.

211
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,028
Love is...

212
00:14:56,771 --> 00:15:01,026
...when your heart skips a beat,
when your eyes lock ..

213
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,826
...and someone steals
your invaluable heart.

214
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,382
Morning, boss.

215
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:22,588
Who stole it?

216
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,720
Sir, when you spread the word..

217
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,146
When you spread the word..

218
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:31,768
...about a reward on the Kohinoor..

219
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,521
...he was the only one who replied.

220
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,315
Through whom?
- Shoaib!

221
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,108
He said Sayeed sent him.

222
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:39,321
Wasim knows him.

223
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,323
And he's also done
a job for Saqlain.

224
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,406
I am not asking about
Pakistan's batting line up.

225
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,617
Is he Indian?

226
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,369
Only an Indian can
perform such a miracle.

227
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:52,619
Feeling patriotic?

228
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,958
<i>Sorry-</i>

229
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,291
He'll contact us as soon
as the diamond reaches India.

230
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,300
Price?

231
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,627
5 million dollars.

232
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:04,259
Fine.

233
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,430
Should we pay by cash?

234
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:06,803
Sure.

235
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,726
Load it in a truck and take it.
- Yes.

236
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,512
Bloody fool.

237
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,438
Open an anonymous
account in Mauritius.

238
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,481
As soon as you get the diamond
transfer the payment into his account.

239
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:15,934
Don't open your mouth.

240
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,940
Get to the bank
and open an account.

241
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,323
Hello, madam.

242
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,123
Thank you, Harleen.

243
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,879
No problem.

244
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,124
Hey Harleen, thanks for the coffee.

245
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,544
You're welcome.

246
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,549
Hello. Bank of Shimla.

247
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,634
Speak here please.

248
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,562
- Hello.

249
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,397
Bank of Shimla.

250
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:08,949
<i>Sorry-</i>

251
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,154
How can I help you?

252
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,782
Which way is the
vice-president's office?

253
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,084
It's the third cabin
in the corridor, to the right.

254
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,253
But he has resigned.

255
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:18,920
There's no one in the cabin.

256
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,124
Now there will be.
- Who?

257
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,418
Me. Karan Saxena.

258
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,175
Bank of Shimla's
youngest vice-president.

259
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:28,348
And anyway,
this is my uncle's bank.

260
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,095
Oh, I am so sorry, sir.

261
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,221
No problem.

262
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,762
Name?
- Harleen Sahani.

263
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,351
Married?
- No.

264
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,224
Boyfriend?

265
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,147
No.

266
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,644
Wouldn't have mattered
if you had one.

267
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:42,986
Come to my cabin.

268
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,780
We need to discuss
the finance strategy.

269
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,198
Strategy?

270
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,985
But...l am a receptionist.

271
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,112
Do you want to be a
receptionist all your life?

272
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,864
Making the right friends..

273
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,415
...Is also a strategy, darling.

274
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,666
Understood.

275
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,791
If you want to turn your
luck around, then come see me.

276
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,563
Sitting all alone with ice-cream..

277
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:22,651
...while, your friends are at
a romantic candle-light dinner...

278
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,274
...with Mr. Right, right now?

279
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:27,531
Don't you worry.

280
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:31,032

is about to change..

281
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,487

00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:04,151
Friends, Mrs. Sharmin Kapadia..

288
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,739
...Is finally retiring
from our bank after 30 years.

289
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,565
Miss...
- What'?

290
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,863
Ms. Kapadia.

291
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:14,287
Who's that?
- That's me!

292
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,448
You aren't married yet?

293
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:19,659
Wow!

294
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,120
Here..

295
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,679
She had no time for marriage.

296
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,977
She spent her entire
life in the bank.

297
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,973
Never took a day off in 30 years.

298
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,150
She never came late
and she never left early.

299
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,275
She stayed single all her life.

300
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,406
And she'll be single
for the rest of her life.

301
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:21,145
- Harleen! Harleen!

302
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,392
What is it, grandma?

303
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,973
- Come here quickly!

304
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,862
What happened, grandma?
- Look...the jewel thief.

305
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,136
So it's you?

306
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,686
If you have what
I think you have...

307
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,605
...then I am who you think I am.

308
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:13,197
Abdul's here...with your order.

309
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,863
Roasted mutton, kebabs, halim..

310
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,077
...and our favorite, firni.

311
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,243
Did you order this?

312
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,826
Hey, Abdul, you're sewing
the wrong people again.

313
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,911
That order's for table no. 7.

314
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,960
Mistakes can happen. Sorry.

315
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,133
5 million dollars
are waiting for you..

316
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,060
...In an account in Mauritius.

317
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,100
One swipe of my finger..

318
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,931
...and your fate
will change forever.

319
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:09,795
What's the hurry?
Let's discuss a few things first.

320
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,830
I am hungry too.

321
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:13,837
Let's eat something.

322
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,126
Abdul.

323
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,808
Grandma,
I am not going to fight a war.

324
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,601
I'm just going on a date.

325
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,140
You're finally settling down.

326
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,146
Now I can die in peace.

327
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:30,475
Enough! I'll be late.

328
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,394
Wait.

329
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,145
Here you go.

330
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,027
Grandpa's car!

331
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,114
It was your grandpa's
most prized possession.

332
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,820
Yes, grandma, I know.

333
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,281
You two went on your first date,
in this car.

334
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,996
I found my true love, in this car.

335
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,295
And today you'll find
your true love, in this car.

336
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,749
Bye Grandma, ok?
- Bye!

337
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,092
You can eat after we leave.

338
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:03,758
I can't think on an empty stomach.

339
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,134
What's there to think about?

340
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,594
The price has been decided.

341
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,433
Give with one hand
and take with the other.

342
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,435
My hands are dirty.

343
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,522
Threats can be expensive.

344
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,482
How expensive?

345
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,533
5 million for each.

346
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,154
All three of you made a mistake..

347
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:28,203
So now the price
is 20 million dollars.

348
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,499
Wrong.

349
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,786
Now the price is zero.

350
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,625
Quietly hand the
diamond over to us.

351
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,208
Wipe your noses all of you.

352
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,095
There's a drug in your buttermilk.

353
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:44,966
In exactly 5 seconds,
your mouths will be frothing..

354
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,676
...and you'll all be unconscious!

355
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:52,064
Oops!

356
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,812
I mixed up the orders. Again!

357
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:56,269
You ordered the buttermilk, right?

358
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:57,603
Thank you, Abdul.

359
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,868
- Get him!

360
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,549
There he is!
On the roof!

361
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:03,002
Shoot him!

362
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,136
There he is.

363
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:19,810
- Get him!

364
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:30,714
- Hey, stop!

365
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,687
- He's trapped.

366
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,562
Yes sir. Sure.

367
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:26,069
We're under pressure from
the Prime Minister's office.

368
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,484
Even the opposition
is extending their support...

369
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:29,816
...on the Kohinoor issue.

370
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,535
This is going to affect
our Extradition Treaty.

371
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,825
They are fools!

372
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:38,787
The Extradition Treaty
can't be put on hold at any cost.

373
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:43,208
Sir, finding the Kohinoor
diamond is imperative. .

374
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:47,416
Sir.

375
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,885
Sir, there's been firing
on Mall Road in Shimla.

376
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,592
So. That's the police's problem.

377
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:56,767
But sir, you should take
a look at the CCTV footage.

378
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,324
Yes, ma'am. How may I help you?

379
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,280
I'm Harleen.

380
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:19,365
I...

381
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:21,746
You're here to
see Mr. Vickie, right?

382
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,457
Right. How do you know that?

383
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,455
We have a tie-up with Trueluvv.com

384
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,586
This way, please.

385
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,760
Have a seat.

386
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,844
If you want to know anything..

387
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:38,972
...about your special friend, then..

388
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,302
Please.

389
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:42,138
Have a nice time, ma'am.

390
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,839
- Ladies and Gentlemen.

391
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:13,636
- Are you ready to win
the Shimla Dance Festival?

392
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,925
- Be there, tomorrow at 7pm.

393
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,381
- Bring your partner.

394
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,349
- Have a great time.

395
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,480
Vickie?

396
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,034
Hi, I'm Vickie.

397
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:20,778
Harleen.

398
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:22,784
Hi Harleen.
Nice to meet you.

399
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,998
You're very late.

400
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,577
And you're very beautiful.

401
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,120
I am sorry.

402
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,419
I'm so late I...
please, sit.

403
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:44,222
So...have you done this before?

404
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:46,595
What?

405
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,808
In a restaurant?
With a beautiful girl?

406
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,812
Once or twice.

407
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:57,398
Internet dating.

408
00:30:58,148 --> 00:30:59,400
Trueluvv.com

409
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:03,287
Trueluvv.. .com?

410
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:08,996
Well...no..

411
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,536
First time.

412
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:12,954
It's my first time.

413
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,123
Mine too.

414
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,549
So why did you choose me?

415
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,130
Really?

416
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:25,217
Look at you.

417
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:29,146
But...l didn't post my picture.

418
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,107
Of course.

419
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:37,821
But the way you described yourself
so beautifully. I was just..

420
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,274
I just wrote two words.

421
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:42,822
Bank receptionist.

422
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,952
Exactly.

423
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:49,583
There's a story hidden
behind those two words.

424
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:51,664
Whose story?

425
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,422
My...grandma's story.

426
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,594
My grandma...
was a bank receptionist too.

427
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:06,425
She made a living attending
calls at the bank..

428
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,011
...and raised all of us.

429
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:15,525
And then one day,
after transferring her last call..

430
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,029
...she passed away.

431
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,198
I am so sorry.

432
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:33,539
What would you like to drink?

433
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:40,800
Some wine?

434
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,137
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

435
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,077
Shimla.

436
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,802
Ahh! French.

437
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,672
It's Indian, sir.

438
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:28,215
From Nasik.

439
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:30,926
Pour it.

440
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:35,473
Enjoy, madam.
- Thanks.

441
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,349
So you travel around a lot.

442
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:38,642
I have to.

443
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,485
To save the world.

444
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:42,395
Huh?

445
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,190
From mosquitoes.

446
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,904
I work for Odomos.

447
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:49,778
And you?

448
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,613
Do you travel?

449
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,115
No.

450
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:57,452
I was 10 years old..

451
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,755
...when grandma brought
me here from Canada.

452
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,424
My mom and dad passed
away in a road accident.

453
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:07,675
I've been here since.

454
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,052
Never been anywhere.

455
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:13,518
But one day
I want to quit my job..

456
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:16,646
...and travel the world.

457
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:19,766
One day.

458
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:21,518
One day.

459
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:28,697
But how will you
know that your "one day" is here?

460
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:34,289
I live in a small city.

461
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:37,872
It's not easy to do what I want.

462
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,913
I live with my grandma.

463
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:43,044
She's my responsibility.

464
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:46,756
One day.

465
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:48,295
One day.

466
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:53,383
So you like dancing?

467
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,011
Yeah!

468
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,470
Well...

469
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,182
Here?
- Yeah!

470
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:01,437
No way.

471
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,978
I just dance sometimes
when I am alone.

472
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,152
Harleen.

473
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:08,940
Come closer.

474
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:13,745
Come closer.

475
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:18,874
A little more.

476
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:27,342
Don't you think that
your "one day" means never?

477
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,213
Today it's your grandma
you're responsible for...

478
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:32,764
...tomorrow it'll be your husband..

479
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,633
...and the day after,
your children.

480
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:40,647
I think you should
do what you want right now.

481
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:45,728
I treat every day as my last.

482
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:49,572
So all I have is... one day.

483
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,824
The day you start
your bucket list...

484
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,948
...that day will be your "one day".

485
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:03,119
But..

486
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,087
Close your eyes.

487
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,581
Huh?

488
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,170
Close your eyes.

489
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:12,754
Trust me!

490
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:20,512
Harleen.

491
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,101
This one's for you.

492
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:31,106
"Such a breeze has blown."

493
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:38,452
"That it took my breath
away from me and towards you."

494
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:42,876
"And then I had this feeling that."

495
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:50,381
"You've started becoming mine,
I've started becoming yours."

496
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:57,888
"I've started becoming yours,
you've started becoming mine."

497
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:01,266
"How this happened?"

498
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:06,396
"Neither I,
nor you have any idea about it."

499
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:12,899
"But my heart has started saying
this since a while that."

500
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:20,456
"You've started becoming mine,
I've started becoming yours."

501
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:27,630
"I've started becoming yours,
you've started becoming mine."

502
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,794
"Neither I, nor you know."

503
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:31,420
"How this miracle has happened?"

504
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,342
"What I had has gotten lost."

505
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:36,888
"it seems as if I've
gotten something that's yours."

506
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:42,891
"When my heart got to know that.."

507
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:50,395
"You've started becoming mine,
I've started becoming yours."

508
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:58,118
"I've started becoming yours,
you've started becoming mine."

509
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:24,223
"Sometimes my heart says."

510
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,431
"This is the only atmosphere."

511
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:31,894
"In which I want to live life
in such a way."

512
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:35,196
"That I live every moment
to the fullest."

513
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:38,567
"In which this strange world
comes and embraces me."

514
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:42,203
"In which you walk and the
whole world walks with you."

515
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:45,783
"And the night softly
whispers in your ears."!

516
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:50,416
"That now it seems as if."

517
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:57,674
"You've started becoming mine,
I've started becoming yours."

518
00:38:57,961 --> 00:39:05,391
"I've started becoming yours,
you've started becoming mine."

519
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:08,556
"Such a breeze has blown."

520
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:15,567
"That it took my breath
away from me and towards you."

521
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:20,442
"And then I had this feeling that."

522
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:25,525
"You've started..."

523
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:42,765
"You've started becoming mine,
I've started becoming yours."

524
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:50,598
"I've started becoming yours,
you've started becoming mine."

525
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:59,482
"You've started becoming mine,
I've started becoming yours."

526
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:07,494
"I've started becoming yours,
you've started becoming mine."

527
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,148
He's so cute.

528
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:41,610
All the girls at the
bank will be so jealous.

529
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:48,906
"Don't you think that
your "one day" means never?"

530
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:58,165
"I think...you should
do what you want right now."

531
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:03,011
Vickie.

532
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,179
He's so calm.

533
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:09,766
So simple.

534
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:19,853
So cultured.

535
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:26,485
Yes, Harleen Sahani.

536
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:27,906
He's right.

537
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:30,614
This moment
will never come again.

538
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,460
- Where's he?

539
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:51,850
Thank you Trueluvv.com!

540
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:05,197
What's all this?

541
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:07,780
It's your Trueluvv.com, madam.

542
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:09,777
Trueluvv.com?

543
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,743
Harleen? Myself Vickie.

544
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,623
So sorry.

545
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,326
My mobile had a flat tire..

546
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:18,127
...and my car battery died.

547
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:22,340
But where's the other Vickie?

548
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,427
The other Vickie left this bill.

549
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:29,555
So long.

550
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,175
Who's going to pay
for the furniture?

551
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:33,514
Your uncle?

552
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,137
You'll have to pay up, madam.

553
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,815
"And anyway,
this bank belongs to my uncle."

554
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:41,017
Uncle...

555
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:44,942
My uncle.

556
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,693
This is his card.

557
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:47,899
He'll pay You'

558
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:49,650
<i>sorry-</i>

559
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:58,163
Trueluvv...

560
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:03,040
If he ever shows up,
I'll run him over with this car!

561
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:09,795
Oh crap!

562
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,471
Oh..

563
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:13,053
<i>I’m sorry!</i>

564
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:15,010
Are you okay?

565
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:17,892
Yeah! I'm good. I'm good.

566
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:19,806
You?
- Hi.

567
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,317
Rajveer.
- What?

568
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,853
My name.
- Yeah, sure.

569
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,282
Like I am going to believe
you after all the lies.

570
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,909
I lied about my name,
but I swear..

571
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,407
...everything else was true.

572
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,664
Okay. Don't move.
One second.

573
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,957
You need a doctor.

574
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,414
I don't need a doctor.

575
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:46,586
Maybe..

576
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:48,300
Maybe, what?

577
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:49,585
Maybe I need a kiss.

578
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:51,337
A kiss?

579
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,139
You're crazy.

580
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:55,424
I'm leaving.

581
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:57,973
I seriously think
you need a doctor.

582
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:00,063
They saw you at the
restaurant with me.

583
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:02,773
Who?

584
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:04,271
They think you know something.

585
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,727
What do I know?

586
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,399
Nothing.
But they don't know that..

587
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,105
They don't know that
I don't know anything.

588
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,610
No, they think you
know something..

589
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:12,567
"But, they don't know
that you don't know anything.

590
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,323
What do I know?
- Nothing.

591
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:15,949
So do they know that?
- Stop.

592
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:19,873
This bullet won't kill
me but this confusion will.

593
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:26,498
Harleen Sahani.

594
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:32,797
So you're saying that
the girl was with him.

595
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:34,422
Yes sir.

596
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:36,683
And this is her uncle's card.

597
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:38,885
Sir, please help
us recover our money.

598
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:41,850
Karan Saxena.

599
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:47,314
Listen to me.

600
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:51,238
I stole something.

601
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:52,565
What?

602
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:57,529
I took the bullet out,
you just need to stitch it up.

603
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:58,704
Stitch...?

604
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:03,125
So...hold this torch,
point it right here.

605
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,369
Here.

606
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:06,712
I can't do this.

607
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:08,414
Of course you can.

608
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,498
Come on.

609
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:10,299
Help-

610
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,421
Hold on.

611
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,002
OK.

612
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,848
Steady, steady.

613
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:25,556
Perfect.

614
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:27,892
Excellent

615
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:32,314
I have never seen anyone
hold the torch so perfectly before.

616
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:33,856
Thanks.

617
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:40,614
Steady. Steady.
- Done?

618
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,114
Steady.

619
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:45,372
Almost done.

620
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:47,036
It's really good.

621
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,712
Thank you so much
for helping me.

622
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:51,457
Okay-

623
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:52,708
Done.

624
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:54,878
Here. Drink this.

625
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,171
Have this.

626
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:28,495
What was in this?

627
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,127
Who are you?

628
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:36,051
Rajveer Nanda,
international criminal.

629
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,967
Pathologically,
psychopathic schizophrenic.

630
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,554
I need psychiatric help.

631
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,051
What?

632
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,683
I don't, but that's
what they're going to say.

633
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,523
What was in the water?

634
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:50,725
Sedatives.

635
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,143
Why?

636
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:53,773
Now listen to me.

637
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:57,023
Two kinds of people
will approach you.

638
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,233
First the government agents.

639
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:01,569
And second those who
aren't government agents.

640
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:03,700
They'll both ask you about me.

641
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,248
When you don't tell them anything..

642
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:09,498
...they'll say that they're
taking you to a 'safe' place.

643
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,417
Why are you stressing on "safe"?

644
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:13,755
Listen to me.

645
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:16,008
There will be a gun
hidden in the car..

646
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,427
...which they'll
use to transport you.

647
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:19,628
Gun?

648
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,135
If it's a Skoda,
it'll be under the left seat.

649
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,850
And if it's a Toyota,
then it'll be under the right.

650
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,101
Okay-

651
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:31,058
Take the gun out and use
it to scare them and escape.

652
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,266
<i>Escape?</i>

653
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:34,860
And if they ask about me...

654
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:39,941
I don't know...

655
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,363
You don't know me.

656
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:46,288
I don't know you...

657
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,115
Perfect.

658
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:50,368
Perfect.

659
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:55,498
Perfect.

660
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:57,708
Perfect.

661
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,722
I don't know anything.

662
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:05,470
Let me go!

663
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:06,930
Where's Shoaib?

664
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,478
I don't know any Shoaib.

665
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:11,518
Forgive me!

666
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:13,683
I swear on my uncle!

667
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:15,810
And he's still alive!

668
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,645
What does this code mean?

669
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:19,898
Harleen, bank receptionist.

670
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:22,362
What code?

671
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,527
Harleen?

672
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:26,575
That's not a code word.

673
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:29,199
Our bank receptionist
is named Harleen.

674
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,282
Yes.

675
00:48:41,544 --> 00:48:42,340
Morning, ma'am.

676
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:43,512
- Absolutely.

677
00:48:45,798 --> 00:48:46,799
Boss..

678
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,727
- We can transfer the funds.

679
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,687
- The consignment will be there.

680
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:13,826
- Goodbye.

681
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:18,585
What's this nonsense?

682
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,382
Boss he got away from us!

683
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:23,382
Got away?
Who wanted to catch him?

684
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,047
You just had to pay
him and take the diamond!

685
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:26,847
That's it.

686
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,595
Shoaib tried to take
it with force, but...

687
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,051
But...he couldn't.

688
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:32,011
Boss, there was a girl with him.

689
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:03,634
"Don't you think that your
"one day" means never?"

690
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,301
"The day you start
your bucket list..."

691
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:15,646
"...that day will
be your "one day".

692
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,327
What's the matter?

693
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,571
What time did you
get home last night?

694
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:43,250
I am not old-fashioned
like your parents, silly!

695
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:45,463
Who was it?

696
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:47,591
"Rajveer."

697
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:50,131
"I lied about the name,
but I swear..."

698
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,558
"...everything else was true."

699
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,102
I don't know.

700
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:57,639
Don't know? How strange!

701
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:00,979
You spent the night with
him and you don't know his name!

702
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:03,026
Even I am not that modern.

703
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,152
I get it.

704
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:11,153
Your heart's finally been stolen.

705
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:31,381
"Ah, there was a little
empty space in my heart."

706
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:34,637
"You came and
acquired it without rent."

707
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:37,766
"I couldn't say anything,
how is this helplessness."

708
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:41,437
"Thus silently came
an uninvited guest."

709
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:44,485
"Ah, there was a little
empty space in my heart."

710
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:48,944
"I don't know
when and how did he come."

711
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:55,781
"What he whispered to the heart?"

712
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:02,795
"I don't know
when and how did he come."

713
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:09,381
"What he whispered to the heart?"

714
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:15,341
"Ah, there was a little
empty space in my heart."

715
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:18,519
"You came and acquired it
without rent."

716
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:21,598
"I couldn't say anything,
how is this helplessness."

717
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:25,526
"Thus silently came
an uninvited guest."

718
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:27,228
"Ah, in my heart..."

719
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:28,904
"In my heart..."

720
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:32,279
"Ah, there was a little
empty space in my heart."

721
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:52,929
"What all will you make me
do in dreams.?"

722
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:58,681
"How many colors should
I change for no reason?"

723
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:02,847
"My poor, foolish heart flutters
in the skies like a balloon."

724
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:06,267
"Gently you called.
Wherever you go, it follows."

725
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:07,977
"it just went with eyes closed."

726
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,607
"Slowly, following you."

727
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:12,406
"Little by little it pulls you.
Whether you look or not."

728
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:17,203
"I don't know
when and how did he come."

729
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:23,622
"What he whispered to the heart?"

730
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:43,263
"To say, it's because of you."

731
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,770
"The whole world seems
to be a new place."

732
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:49,978
"To say, it's because of you."

733
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:53,280
"The whole world seems
to be a new place."

734
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:56,734
"Everyone knows and
everybody has an idea."

735
00:53:56,817 --> 00:53:58,694
"Whatever has happened."

736
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:06,411
"See, now you also
stop giving excuses."

737
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:11,253
"Give me the gift
of heart for heart."

738
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:16,630
"Ah, there was a little
empty space in my heart."

739
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:21,100
"I don't know
when and how did he come."

740
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:27,890
"What he whispered to the heart?"

741
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:36,487
"Ah, there was a little
empty space in my heart."

742
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:37,566
Madam.

743
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:39,360
Madam, what's going on?

744
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:41,240
This is the office, not your home.

745
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,038
The phone's ringing, answer it.

746
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:53,124
Hello, Bank of Shimla.

747
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,926
No, sir. Wrong number.

748
00:55:04,593 --> 00:55:06,220
Hi, how can I help you?

749
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:07,930
Open...

750
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:10,098
What?

751
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:13,774
A big account needs to be opened.

752
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,487
Sorry, sir.

753
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:20,075
Since you must have
been paid big money...

754
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:22,619
...for what you did last night.

755
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,154
Excuse me?

756
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:26,539
What nonsense.

757
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:29,535
Maybe.

758
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:33,331
Maybe to get rid
of your loneliness...

759
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:35,086
...you visited that site...

760
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:38,844
Trueluvv.com

761
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:41,471
What happens on this site?

762
00:55:43,382 --> 00:55:45,009
I visited that site once.

763
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,769
It gets really
interesting at night.

764
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,688
No it was only
for the investigation.

765
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:52,979
Investigation.
Nothing more.

766
00:55:56,562 --> 00:55:59,111
Zorawar Kalra, government agent.

767
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,442
We need to have a little
chat about what you did last night.

768
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:04,740
Some Q&A.

769
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:08,703
But, if you prefer,
we can talk right here.

770
00:56:09,575 --> 00:56:10,872
In front of everyone.

771
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:20,757
Ms. Sahani,
the man you were with last night...

772
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:22,838
...is an international criminal.

773
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,886
Mentally unstable
and pathologically...

774
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:27,559
Psychopathic schizophrenic.

775
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:32,064
He told me you would say that.

776
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:36,735
Just like I thought.
He's too smart.

777
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:38,855
He's using you.

778
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:40,902
Just have a look.

779
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:54,161
Criminals like him
are very charming.

780
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,460
He can drug you.

781
00:56:58,707 --> 00:57:00,801
He can kill you.
Take your life.

782
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:05,597
Excuse me.

783
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:08,551
Sir...we crossed
the police station.

784
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:09,680
Yes.

785
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,856
Your life's in danger, so
we're taking you to a safe place.

786
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:19,315
"Safe place?"

787
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:25,159
Yes, but why are
you saying it like that?

788
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:28,286
No reason.

789
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,999
'If it's a Skoda,
it'll be under the left seat.'

790
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:39,748
'And if it's a Toyota,
then it'll be under the right.'

791
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:41,921
What car is this?

792
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:44,382
It's a Honda.
- Why do you ask?

793
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:46,713
It's nice.

794
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,383
What's the mileage?

795
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,309
10-12 on the highway.

796
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:53,390
It also depends on the driving.

797
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,938
If we're chasing someone...

798
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:56,640
...we use the brake
and accelerator more.

799
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,817
In a situation like that
the mileage drops to around 7-7 1/2

800
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:01,562
Yes, sir.
- Are you trying to sell it?

801
00:58:02,229 --> 00:58:03,151
- No, sir.

802
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:04,482
- Sorry, sir.

803
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,863
Yes...we're just getting there.

804
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:09,361
Stop the car!

805
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:12,447
The girl's got a gun.

806
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:14,575
Where did you get that gun?

807
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:15,742
Stop the car!

808
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:17,043
Keep driving,
she won't do anything.

809
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:18,166
Come on, give me that gun!

810
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,711
I didn't do that!
- Give me the gun!

811
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:23,667
I don't know how to fire a gun!
- Come on.

812
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:31,933
Sir, that bike's missing a rider.

813
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:33,468
Oh God!

814
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:47,323
Where did he go?

815
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,409
Where did he go, sir?

816
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:53,406
There he is, sir.

817
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:00,037
Hey!

818
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:03,957
Stop that girl.

819
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:05,588
Hey girl.

820
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:07,837
Stop her! Stop her!

821
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:10,138
I will kill you. Stop!

822
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:22,184
Mummy, mummy.

823
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:23,484
What is it, son?

824
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:36,657
Hey, Harleen...

825
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:38,749
Hey Trueluvv.

826
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:40,327
What?

827
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:43,672
Closer...come on,
you can do it.

828
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:44,706
What?

829
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:45,791
Flip"-

830
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:47,292
What?

831
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:48,835
Come on!

832
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:51,379
Hey!

833
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:08,571
The wire.

834
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:10,565
- Careful.

835
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:28,834
Hurry up.

836
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:30,085
Left.

837
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:33,880
Drive faster.

838
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:57,655
Mind if drive?
- Huh!

839
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:58,738
Shift, Harleen.

840
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:01,583
Trust me. Shift.
- Hold on a second.

841
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:09,124
What's up'?

842
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:20,893
Are you crazy?

843
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:26,899
Ram him!

844
01:01:26,892 --> 01:01:28,144
- Don't let him get away.

845
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,166
What are you doing?

846
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:10,985
Please, stop the car!

847
01:02:14,189 --> 01:02:15,657
Rajveer, stop the car!

848
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:25,871
- Have you lost your mind?

849
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:27,661
Rajveer...

850
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,427
Don't get out of the car.

851
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:41,550
Help!

852
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:44,227
This man's crazy.
lam not with him.

853
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:47,555
I'm with you. I'm with you.

854
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:49,683
I'm with you.

855
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:52,519
What did I say?

856
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:53,649
Don't get out of the car.

857
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:55,571
What did you do?
- I got out of the car.

858
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:57,445
Harleen, understand.

859
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:01,741
Either you're safe with me...
or "safe“ with them.

860
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:04,039
Safe or...
- Safe. Safe.

861
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:05,498
Good.
Hold this.

862
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:07,367
Shift a bit.

863
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:12,335
Thank you.

864
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:15,709
Please stop killing people!

865
01:03:16,084 --> 01:03:17,586
Please stop killing people!

866
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:19,045
Please...

867
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:24,308
You're in shock. I understand.

868
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:27,725
Wait here, and I'll go
explain a few things to them.

869
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:28,930
Yes.

870
01:03:29,014 --> 01:03:29,981
Okay-

871
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,900
Actually you know what,
I won't lie.

872
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:35,111
I'm just going to shoot them.

873
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,363
By the way, you drive really well.

874
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:42,243
I mean...

875
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:43,616
You saved our lives today.

876
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:45,743
I just... I want you to know that.

877
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:47,825
I'm really impressed.

878
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:52,412
Wait here, I'll...
I'll be back.

879
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:33,874
"Safe."

880
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:40,047
Harleen.
- Karan.

881
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:42,299
Harleen, Harleen.
I've been looking for you.

882
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:43,346
Karan, I'm in big trouble.

883
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:44,217
Trouble?

884
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:46,174
They slapped me because of you.

885
01:04:46,174 --> 01:04:47,767
I was shot at.

886
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:49,594
They drank my expensive champagne.

887
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:51,304
Who?
- Government agents.

888
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:53,940
But why?
- Because you work for Shoaib.

889
01:04:54,516 --> 01:04:55,642
Who's Shoaib?

890
01:04:55,934 --> 01:04:57,436
- Omar Zafar's right-hand man!

891
01:04:57,519 --> 01:04:58,736
Who's Omar Zafar?

892
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:04,196
Excuse me, who are you'?

893
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:05,239
That's him.

894
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:06,865
He's the reason you were slapped..

895
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:08,322
...and I was shot at.

896
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:10,119
Rajveer, what are you doing here'?

897
01:05:10,198 --> 01:05:11,199
Rajveer ?

898
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:12,834
Rajveer who?

899
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:16,421
The one that's going to
smack you if you don't shut up.

900
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:22,048
Now listen carefully.

901
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:24,133
I'm taking your car.

902
01:05:24,212 --> 01:05:25,464
Hello...

903
01:05:25,547 --> 01:05:29,347
Rajveer Zafar,
don't you dare look at my car...

904
01:05:29,551 --> 01:05:31,098
...or I'll break your hands.

905
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:33,054
I am a green-belt
in kung fu karate.

906
01:05:33,138 --> 01:05:37,359
My flying kick is so fast that I can
knock a flying bird out of the air.

907
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,940
Oh uncle..

908
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:40,895
You shot him.

909
01:05:40,979 --> 01:05:42,481
You shot me.

910
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:43,941
Harleen, get in the car.

911
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:46,617
Why did you shoot him?
- Why did you shoot me?

912
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:49,662
Harleen, get in the car.
- Don't get in the car, Harleen.

913
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:52,958
Harleen, get in the car.

914
01:05:57,871 --> 01:05:58,918
It's a flesh wound.

915
01:05:59,581 --> 01:06:01,174
Nowhere close to the bone.

916
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:03,338
Good shot, huh?

917
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:05,512
Very good. But why?

918
01:06:05,587 --> 01:06:07,305
You were about to use
your flying kick on me.

919
01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:08,890
Couldn't take a chance.

920
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:10,512
Now listen.

921
01:06:10,842 --> 01:06:13,345
Count to 100 after we leave.

922
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:16,056
Then you can call the police,
ambulance, everyone.

923
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:17,140
Okay-

924
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:19,480
If you call them before
you count to 100..

925
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:21,520
...I'll come back and shoot you.

926
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:23,446
But how will you know?

927
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,990
I'll shoot you even if you
ask stupid questions.

928
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:28,860
I'll count till 200...
swear on my uncle.

929
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:30,862
Good.

930
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:38,370
Please fasten your seatbelt.

931
01:06:39,913 --> 01:06:41,540
One...uncle..

932
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:42,790
Two...

933
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:44,334
Three...uncle...

934
01:06:53,593 --> 01:06:55,971
By the way,
I didn't want to shoot him.

935
01:06:56,638 --> 01:06:57,855
Then why did you?

936
01:06:57,931 --> 01:07:01,481
Those who don't want to shoot,
don't shoot.

937
01:07:02,185 --> 01:07:04,313
That bullet's going to make him..

938
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:05,647
...the hero of this city.

939
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,192
You're crazy.

940
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:09,275
You're insane.

941
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,862
You just shoot at anyone.

942
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:15,453
That's just not normal. That's
not normal by any definition.

943
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:17,747
I know what I'm doing.

944
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:19,665
Please stop the car.

945
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:21,163
I want to go home.

946
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:22,629
Away from you.

947
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:25,921
Relax Harleen. Just calm down.

948
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:28,211
Maybe I was safe with them.

949
01:07:32,257 --> 01:07:33,383
What did you just say?

950
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:37,475
And you're scared to be with me.

951
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:40,814
I should never have trusted you.

952
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:44,519
Really?

953
01:07:49,357 --> 01:07:50,449
Oh...okay.

954
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:53,243
Okay then.

955
01:08:16,718 --> 01:08:18,641
- Megha, listen to me.

956
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:20,308
- Listen to me.

957
01:08:20,305 --> 01:08:21,852
- I don't want to talk to you.
- Why not?

958
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:23,183
- I don't want to talk to you.
- Why?

959
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:25,644
- I don't want to.
- Okay, I am sorry.

960
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:26,769
- Please.

961
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,487
Excuse me.

962
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:30,572
Excuse me.

963
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:33,284
How can you just leave
me like this and go?

964
01:08:33,985 --> 01:08:35,032
Answer me.

965
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:38,115
Why did you shoot Karan
if you didn't need me?

966
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:40,374
And why are you stealing that car?

967
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,873
Why did you steal this one,
if you didn't need it?

968
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:45,204
And you say you're not crazy?

969
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:48,796
What do you want?

970
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:51,302
You've a problem if I'm with you.

971
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:53,426
Now I'm going away,
and you still have a problem.

972
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:56,800
Look, I am really sorry
that we have to be together..

973
01:08:56,883 --> 01:08:59,432
...but it's only to
ensure you stay alive.

974
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:01,972
If I'm not with you, you're dead.

975
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:04,353
Do you understand that?
Dead!

976
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:07,360
And maybe you'll find this strange.

977
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:10,526
But I've other things to do
apart from saving your life.

978
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:13,153
And they are quite important.

979
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:15,902
And...

980
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:19,368
You know what...

981
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:21,787
I don't really care anymore.

982
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:25,210
Here's the key, there's the car.

983
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:27,918
Drive home.

984
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:09,247
- A for Assam J for Jammu.

985
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:10,627
7739.

986
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:13,631
- Check every white BMW in the city.

987
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:17,597
- The suspect is in HP-51-AJ 7739..

988
01:10:51,873 --> 01:10:52,874
Look..

989
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,923
...till today I've never been the..

990
01:10:58,129 --> 01:11:00,131
...cause of death
of an innocent person.

991
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:04,268
I don't want you to be the first.

992
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:10,521
Especially, when you've been waiting
for that "one day" all your life.

993
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:14,312
Your dreams would've died with you.

994
01:11:22,487 --> 01:11:23,488
Are you hungry?

995
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,201
Let's eat.

996
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:42,515
Do you have money?

997
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:46,848
Don't you work in a bank?

998
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:49,313
That's so stupid.

999
01:11:49,597 --> 01:11:51,099
What if I worked at a hospital?

1000
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:52,775
Would I be carrying medicines?

1001
01:11:54,936 --> 01:11:56,404
Now what?

1002
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:00,192
Shoot someone.

1003
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:04,325
You like that, don't you...
shooting people?

1004
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:08,242
If he doesn't give you free food,
shoot him.

1005
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:11,202
Again? Really?

1006
01:12:12,537 --> 01:12:14,585
I shot them to save your life.

1007
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,423
Please can we move on
from that now?

1008
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:19,293
I never asked for your help.

1009
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:20,928
I can manage.

1010
01:12:21,295 --> 01:12:22,467
Can I take your order, sir?

1011
01:12:22,547 --> 01:12:25,642
My life was perfect,
until I met you.

1012
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:27,760
Perfect?

1013
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:31,939
No wonder you were
begging on the internet.

1014
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:33,649
Me Harleen, bank receptionist.

1015
01:12:33,933 --> 01:12:35,731
Please meet me. Please.

1016
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:37,941
Somebody please.
Internet hello, help.

1017
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,237
- Hello. Please.
Help somebody.

1018
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:41,816
Anybody out there? Hello
Please somebody?

1019
01:12:41,899 --> 01:12:43,025
Nobody? No?

1020
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:53,666
We can't decide between
thin crust or stuffed crust.

1021
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:54,628
That's the problem.

1022
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:56,497
Why don't you try a pan-pizza?

1023
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:58,382
What would you like, honey?

1024
01:12:58,457 --> 01:12:59,583
Don't call me honey.

1025
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:01,260
Then give me some money.

1026
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:06,469
Actually you know what,
I'll just shoot him.

1027
01:13:07,842 --> 01:13:09,765
What am I thinking?
I should just do it. Yeah.

1028
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:10,928
Don't.

1029
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:12,226
Here's the money.

1030
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:13,932
Just don't shoot anyone, please.

1031
01:13:15,182 --> 01:13:17,651
Two pan pizzas, please.
And two Mountain Dews.

1032
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:21,238
- And we're with Karan Saxena..

1033
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:24,450
- ..Who risked his life to
try and catch a dangerous criminal.

1034
01:13:24,525 --> 01:13:27,779
- He shot at Harleen...
but I intervened.

1035
01:13:27,862 --> 01:13:29,409
- But the bullet hit your leg.

1036
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:30,990
- It was a kung-fu style jump.

1037
01:13:31,157 --> 01:13:38,006
- My flying... kick is so fast,
I can kick a flying bird in the air.

1038
01:13:43,586 --> 01:13:47,216
What have you done that so many
people are gunning for your life?

1039
01:14:07,026 --> 01:14:09,449
Do I need to solve
that to get an answer?

1040
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:19,997
Nice.

1041
01:14:20,748 --> 01:14:21,749
What is it?

1042
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:23,460
Don't you read the papers?

1043
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:37,266
Please tell me this isn't something
that starts... with the letter K.

1044
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:44,606
Are you crazy?

1045
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:48,822
That's the..

1046
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:50,698
You're a thief.

1047
01:14:51,112 --> 01:14:54,742
I thought you were on a mission.

1048
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:57,577
To save the country, the world.

1049
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:02,374
I can't believe I trusted you.

1050
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:05,050
You still trust me.

1051
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:06,589
Yeah, right.

1052
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:09,722
That's why you haven't
raised your voice yet.

1053
01:15:11,298 --> 01:15:13,642
You can expose
me whenever you like.

1054
01:15:14,093 --> 01:15:16,437
But why did you steal the Kohinoor?

1055
01:15:16,595 --> 01:15:17,767
- For Omar Zafar.

1056
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:26,360
There are women
and children around.

1057
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:29,070
Let's talk peacefully?

1058
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:36,957
Omar Zafar.

1059
01:15:37,324 --> 01:15:40,544
The no.1 criminal on
lnterpol's most wanted list.

1060
01:15:41,245 --> 01:15:44,840
As soon as he put a reward
on the Kohinoor, Rajveer stole it.

1061
01:15:47,752 --> 01:15:49,971
The restaurant has been surrounded.

1062
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:52,260
Escape is impossible.

1063
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:56,059
So if you come with us quietly..

1064
01:15:56,677 --> 01:15:58,020
...It'll be good for everyone.

1065
01:16:01,849 --> 01:16:05,899
As far as I know, he isn't
going to come with us quietly.

1066
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:07,981
So you decide..

1067
01:16:08,522 --> 01:16:13,949
...do you want to stay safe
with us or die for this thief?

1068
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:18,575
- Decide now.

1069
01:16:22,203 --> 01:16:23,420
Is it true?

1070
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:31,762
You know, even after
everything that's happened..

1071
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:34,841
...my heart was telling
me you're a good guy.

1072
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:42,766
Crazy...but not a criminal.

1073
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:47,153
I was wrong.

1074
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:49,980
I am leaving.

1075
01:16:51,398 --> 01:16:52,775
I am sorry, Harleen.

1076
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:57,121
But I can't let you go.

1077
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:03,702
" Boys!

1078
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:20,303
What a jump, sir.

1079
01:17:21,512 --> 01:17:25,062
By the way,
that's a one-way ticket to heaven.

1080
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:29,983
He won't die so easily.

1081
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:34,199
Someone is watching over him.

1082
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:51,334
Don't worry, Harleen.

1083
01:17:52,001 --> 01:17:53,048
We're safe.

1084
01:18:04,471 --> 01:18:05,939
Time to jump!

1085
01:18:07,558 --> 01:18:08,855
Trust me.

1086
01:18:09,059 --> 01:18:10,857
Conquer your fears, Harleen!

1087
01:18:37,838 --> 01:18:39,181
Who are you?

1088
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:53,126
Hey!

1089
01:19:54,248 --> 01:19:55,465
Good morning.

1090
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:57,593
You shot me!

1091
01:19:58,168 --> 01:19:59,385
Ssssshhhh!

1092
01:19:59,712 --> 01:20:00,634
Ssshhhh!

1093
01:20:00,713 --> 01:20:01,965
Don't 'sssshhh' me!

1094
01:20:02,172 --> 01:20:03,799
You shot me!

1095
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:07,728
If I had shot you,
I wouldn't need to 'ssshhh' you.

1096
01:20:10,723 --> 01:20:12,896
It was a dart. A dart.

1097
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:14,894
A tranquilizer.

1098
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:19,440
Whatever it was,
why did you shoot me?

1099
01:20:20,107 --> 01:20:20,903
<i>HEY '</i>

1100
01:20:20,983 --> 01:20:22,576
- I'm talking to you.

1101
01:20:23,193 --> 01:20:26,743
- It was a tranquilizer dart.
I could've died.

1102
01:20:27,114 --> 01:20:28,331
Ssshhhh...
- Ssshhhh!

1103
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:30,000
What the hell do
you think of yourself?

1104
01:20:30,367 --> 01:20:31,619
I'll show you.

1105
01:20:31,952 --> 01:20:34,421
I'll show you.

1106
01:20:39,126 --> 01:20:41,549
I sedated you for your own good.

1107
01:20:42,421 --> 01:20:45,015
If I hadn't saved you..
- They would've killed me.

1108
01:20:45,341 --> 01:20:46,342
Right?

1109
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:48,177
Right.

1110
01:20:49,136 --> 01:20:51,855
By the way, you're looking good in
these clothes that I bought for you.

1111
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:54,266
Now go to the room
and dry these clothes..

1112
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:56,268
...because we don't
have any more clothes.

1113
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:00,814
My clothes?

1114
01:21:01,648 --> 01:21:03,400
Who changed my clothes?

1115
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:05,574
Relax, I changed them myself.

1116
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:07,537
You?
- I swear.

1117
01:21:08,197 --> 01:21:09,665
You changed my clothes.

1118
01:21:09,782 --> 01:21:11,250
Yes... oh!

1119
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:13,035
I see.

1120
01:21:14,995 --> 01:21:16,247
Come on, Harleen.

1121
01:21:16,455 --> 01:21:19,425
If I can evade 50 guards,
100 security cameras..

1122
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:22,135
...and steal the Kohinoor
from the Tower of London..

1123
01:21:22,336 --> 01:21:24,680
...then, why can't I change
your clothes with my eyes closed?

1124
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:28,263
I'm not admitting that
my eyes were closed, but..

1125
01:21:28,926 --> 01:21:29,973
I deserved that.

1126
01:21:30,135 --> 01:21:31,136
Okay"

1127
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:32,721
Oh...

1128
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:40,730
Look Harleen, you're
really good at martial arts..

1129
01:21:41,772 --> 01:21:43,274
...but save it for later.

1130
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:45,116
I'm hungry right now.

1131
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:47,152
Can we eat?

1132
01:21:48,612 --> 01:21:49,613
Let's eat.

1133
01:22:10,676 --> 01:22:12,303
- Can you tell us where Harleen is?

1134
01:22:12,386 --> 01:22:14,388
- We want to know where Harleen is.

1135
01:22:16,974 --> 01:22:19,477
I cannot answer any
of your questions..

1136
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,358
...without first
consulting my lawyer.

1137
01:22:21,437 --> 01:22:24,691
Grandma, please stop
watching American serials.

1138
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:27,947
Hello!

1139
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:30,449
Grandma!
- Who? Harleen.

1140
01:22:30,529 --> 01:22:31,280
Harleen.

1141
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:33,457
Look, Harleen's on the line.

1142
01:22:33,532 --> 01:22:34,533
Hello.

1143
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:36,869
Grandma! Grandma!

1144
01:22:57,556 --> 01:22:59,229
Sir, we've traced the location.

1145
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:07,358
Have you finished sight-seeing?

1146
01:23:10,068 --> 01:23:11,741
It's a pretty big island.

1147
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:18,703
If you want to kill me,
then please kill me.

1148
01:23:19,244 --> 01:23:21,588
I don't want to kill you, Harleen.

1149
01:23:22,289 --> 01:23:25,338
I just want to finish
cooking dinner.

1150
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:29,004
Come on.

1151
01:23:35,385 --> 01:23:37,058
You can cook too?

1152
01:23:37,137 --> 01:23:39,765
Cooking was my third
subject in school.

1153
01:23:41,391 --> 01:23:42,984
Which school did you go to?

1154
01:23:43,227 --> 01:23:44,228
DPS.

1155
01:23:44,353 --> 01:23:45,900
Delhi Public School.

1156
01:23:46,355 --> 01:23:47,572
Dehradun Public School.

1157
01:23:51,568 --> 01:23:53,195
Who are you?

1158
01:23:55,656 --> 01:23:56,873
A thief.

1159
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:02,246
So it is true.

1160
01:24:03,247 --> 01:24:05,841
You stole the Kohinoor
for Omar Zafar.

1161
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:07,459
Yes.

1162
01:24:10,212 --> 01:24:12,010
But did I ever say
I'm giving it to him?

1163
01:24:12,089 --> 01:24:13,386
Then why did you steal it?

1164
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:15,718
So that no one else steals it.

1165
01:24:15,926 --> 01:24:18,395
It's "safe" with me.

1166
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:20,597
Why don't you hand
it over to the police..

1167
01:24:20,681 --> 01:24:22,183
...or the government?

1168
01:24:24,685 --> 01:24:26,608
You girls are so cute.

1169
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:28,647
"Why don't you hand
it over to someone?"

1170
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:31,950
Harleen, Omar Zafar..

1171
01:24:32,276 --> 01:24:34,699
...has contacts within
the police and the government.

1172
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:37,656
No one can be trusted.

1173
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:41,877
Right?
- Right.

1174
01:24:42,286 --> 01:24:43,287
Right.

1175
01:24:44,746 --> 01:24:46,043
Then what's the plan?

1176
01:24:46,123 --> 01:24:47,124
Plan?

1177
01:24:52,004 --> 01:24:53,256
There's no plan.

1178
01:24:54,298 --> 01:24:56,926
Right now everyone's
trying to figure out my plan.

1179
01:24:57,384 --> 01:24:59,853
And they must be trying
to make a counter-plan.

1180
01:25:00,554 --> 01:25:02,272
But, if I don't have a plan..

1181
01:25:02,472 --> 01:25:04,190
...how will they catch me?

1182
01:25:06,143 --> 01:25:09,693
That is the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

1183
01:25:10,314 --> 01:25:11,406
Yeah!

1184
01:25:15,652 --> 01:25:17,780
So...is this your hideout?

1185
01:25:18,989 --> 01:25:20,411
Yes. One of them.

1186
01:25:21,366 --> 01:25:22,834
How many more do you have?

1187
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:25,003
12. No, make that 11.

1188
01:25:26,413 --> 01:25:28,211
The one in Burma
blew up last month.

1189
01:25:32,753 --> 01:25:36,428
You talk such rubbish!

1190
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:42,684
Who are you?
And what do you really do?

1191
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,483
I'll never know.

1192
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:49,440
- There he is.

1193
01:25:50,687 --> 01:25:51,734
Harleen!

1194
01:26:00,656 --> 01:26:01,908
How is that possible?

1195
01:26:02,532 --> 01:26:04,125
No one saw us coming here.

1196
01:26:04,785 --> 01:26:06,332
And I didn't make any calls.

1197
01:26:06,662 --> 01:26:07,834
And you..

1198
01:26:09,498 --> 01:26:11,626
L...made a call..

1199
01:26:12,209 --> 01:26:14,177
...from your phone. Sorry.
- Oh, God. Harleen!

1200
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:28,437
Come on, let's go.

1201
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:52,874
Hands UP!

1202
01:26:58,213 --> 01:26:59,465
What should I kill you for?

1203
01:27:00,006 --> 01:27:01,883
For trying to catch me, or..

1204
01:27:02,759 --> 01:27:04,761
...for bringing along
only four men to catch me.

1205
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:08,515
I stole the Kohinoor dude!

1206
01:27:09,516 --> 01:27:11,018
Show me some respect.

1207
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:13,357
Hand over the Kohinoor...

1208
01:27:13,562 --> 01:27:15,314
...or Zafar will not spare you.

1209
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:18,366
And where do I find this Zafar?

1210
01:27:18,692 --> 01:27:19,864
I don't know.

1211
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:21,486
Speak up.

1212
01:27:21,862 --> 01:27:23,489
Zafar never meets anyone.

1213
01:27:25,699 --> 01:27:27,747
Then who were you going
to hand over the Kohinoor to?

1214
01:27:29,119 --> 01:27:30,120
Huh?

1215
01:27:32,205 --> 01:27:33,878
Tell me!

1216
01:27:34,374 --> 01:27:37,093
Zafar won't care if you're dead.

1217
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:39,714
Gul. Hamid Gul.

1218
01:27:40,547 --> 01:27:43,517
My job was to hand
over the Kohinoor to Hamid.

1219
01:27:44,301 --> 01:27:45,427
Wonderful.

1220
01:27:46,428 --> 01:27:48,055
And where can I find him?

1221
01:27:54,811 --> 01:27:55,937
Think about it.

1222
01:27:56,730 --> 01:28:00,451
Gul or...death!

1223
01:28:01,651 --> 01:28:03,619
I'll tell you!

1224
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:05,743
Bel Air... Prague.

1225
01:28:06,031 --> 01:28:07,032
Bel Air.

1226
01:28:09,534 --> 01:28:11,332
- He's over there.
- Everybody, move.

1227
01:28:17,334 --> 01:28:19,257
She's over there.
- Get them!

1228
01:31:23,019 --> 01:31:24,441
Welcome to Prague.

1229
01:31:32,362 --> 01:31:34,205
We can't stay here too long.

1230
01:31:34,698 --> 01:31:35,915
So we should..

1231
01:31:37,784 --> 01:31:40,788
You know,
my life was really simple.

1232
01:31:42,455 --> 01:31:44,503
Just me and grandma.

1233
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:46,631
Bank and home.

1234
01:31:47,585 --> 01:31:50,259
I never imagined life beyond that.

1235
01:31:51,297 --> 01:31:53,299
Since I've met you..

1236
01:31:53,508 --> 01:31:55,931
...life has turned
into an action film.

1237
01:31:57,804 --> 01:31:59,556
God knows what will happen next.

1238
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:04,649
But I'm not scared now.

1239
01:32:07,397 --> 01:32:08,865
I trust you.

1240
01:32:16,156 --> 01:32:19,080
You've made my dreams come true.

1241
01:32:21,786 --> 01:32:22,833
You...

1242
01:32:24,497 --> 01:32:26,545
...what is your dream?

1243
01:32:30,837 --> 01:32:32,384
We should go.

1244
01:32:33,048 --> 01:32:34,766
What's your "one day"?

1245
01:32:46,186 --> 01:32:47,187
Home.

1246
01:32:50,106 --> 01:32:51,528
After it's all over...

1247
01:32:54,319 --> 01:32:55,787
...home sweet home.

1248
01:33:01,409 --> 01:33:02,456
One day.

1249
01:33:11,503 --> 01:33:12,971
Where are we going?

1250
01:33:51,835 --> 01:33:56,466
"The desires of the heart
were a little less."

1251
01:33:57,757 --> 01:34:02,763
"All my prayers
were also a little light."

1252
01:34:03,221 --> 01:34:07,317
"But when you put your head
on my shoulders.“

1253
01:34:09,185 --> 01:34:13,110
"it was as if you tied
the thread in the shrine."

1254
01:34:15,066 --> 01:34:19,412
"Without asking I've
gotten everything"

1255
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:25,249
"God has showered
his benevolence upon me."

1256
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:30,660
"God has showered
his benevolence upon me."

1257
01:34:49,184 --> 01:34:54,816
"Let me take your hands in mine."

1258
01:34:54,898 --> 01:35:00,496
"So that I can read my fate."

1259
01:35:01,112 --> 01:35:06,619
"I look for the wishes,
hiding in your eyes."

1260
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:12,458
"So that as you think of a wish
and I fulfill it."

1261
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:16,503
"Just a while ago
I was incomplete."

1262
01:35:16,669 --> 01:35:19,092
"Now I am complete
as I am in front of you."

1263
01:35:19,464 --> 01:35:20,932
"I can't even see ..

1264
01:35:21,132 --> 01:35:24,557
"Where I end and where you begin."

1265
01:35:24,636 --> 01:35:29,483
"When your eyes fall on me."

1266
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:35,447
"Then only I am able to sleep."

1267
01:35:36,064 --> 01:35:39,989
"Since a few days I am feeling."

1268
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:45,870
"You are my worship
and you are my faith."

1269
01:35:47,784 --> 01:35:51,914
"Without any reason,
out of nowhere."

1270
01:35:52,455 --> 01:35:58,007
"God has showered
his benevolence upon me."

1271
01:35:58,503 --> 01:36:03,760
"God has showered
his benevolence upon me."

1272
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:09,932
"God has showered
his benevolence upon me."

1273
01:36:34,372 --> 01:36:37,091
"God has created everyone."

1274
01:36:37,333 --> 01:36:39,802
"But who should go
and tell God that.."

1275
01:36:39,877 --> 01:36:45,099
"..only while dying for you,
I breathe."

1276
01:36:46,134 --> 01:36:49,058
"The prayers that I make to God.."

1277
01:36:49,262 --> 01:36:51,811
"..all of them reach you now."

1278
01:36:51,889 --> 01:36:58,022
"if you hear them,
then God hears it too."

1279
01:36:58,771 --> 01:37:01,775
"The world doesn't know,
even I don't know where."

1280
01:37:01,858 --> 01:37:04,407
"Both of us got united."

1281
01:37:04,652 --> 01:37:09,203
"it's true that
there's no one like you."

1282
01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:14,212
"You are the destination
to all my roads."

1283
01:37:15,747 --> 01:37:20,503
"In this life, and in every life."

1284
01:37:21,169 --> 01:37:24,764
"Let's try and stop time now."

1285
01:37:27,175 --> 01:37:30,975
"Let's teach it
the meaning of love."

1286
01:37:33,139 --> 01:37:37,235
"It'll surely stop being stubborn
and agree to us."

1287
01:37:37,643 --> 01:37:43,150
"God has showered
his benevolence upon me."

1288
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:48,822
"God has showered
his benevolence upon me."

1289
01:37:49,572 --> 01:37:54,749
"God has showered
his benevolence upon me."

1290
01:37:55,578 --> 01:38:00,960
"God has showered
his benevolence upon me."

1291
01:38:25,983 --> 01:38:27,485
Where are we going?

1292
01:38:28,027 --> 01:38:29,745
Not we, just me.

1293
01:38:30,571 --> 01:38:31,663
You stay here.

1294
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:33,579
Order something from room-service.

1295
01:38:33,658 --> 01:38:36,002
I believe the sushi's really good.

1296
01:38:36,994 --> 01:38:38,712
I'll be back soon, okay?

1297
01:38:38,996 --> 01:38:39,997
No.

1298
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:43,585
You don't know this,
but you need me.

1299
01:38:45,294 --> 01:38:46,591
We're a team now.

1300
01:38:47,922 --> 01:38:49,219
Harleen.

1301
01:38:49,298 --> 01:38:53,428
Take me along,
or...I'll follow you.

1302
01:38:57,348 --> 01:38:59,646
Get ready.
- Okay.

1303
01:39:58,618 --> 01:39:59,619
Police.

1304
01:40:13,341 --> 01:40:15,389
Don't try to kiss me.

1305
01:40:16,052 --> 01:40:18,054
It never crossed my mind.

1306
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:19,977
Liar.

1307
01:40:20,681 --> 01:40:21,898
You did.

1308
01:40:22,767 --> 01:40:23,768
No.

1309
01:40:25,770 --> 01:40:26,896
Did you?

1310
01:40:28,397 --> 01:40:29,398
No.

1311
01:40:33,319 --> 01:40:34,992
Have you ever kissed anyone?

1312
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:38,833
Of course I have.

1313
01:40:39,659 --> 01:40:40,660
Really?

1314
01:40:41,410 --> 01:40:42,411
When?

1315
01:40:43,538 --> 01:40:44,790
In school.

1316
01:40:45,498 --> 01:40:46,499
No.

1317
01:40:47,542 --> 01:40:49,044
After that.

1318
01:40:50,836 --> 01:40:52,213
<i>Impossible.</i>

1319
01:40:57,718 --> 01:41:00,938
See? I do know how to kiss.

1320
01:41:02,682 --> 01:41:04,400
You call that a kiss?

1321
01:41:05,977 --> 01:41:06,978
Yes.

1322
01:41:07,895 --> 01:41:08,862
Why?

1323
01:41:10,940 --> 01:41:13,113
This...is a kiss.

1324
01:42:21,927 --> 01:42:23,349
What do we do now?

1325
01:42:24,013 --> 01:42:26,391
I need to find someone
to give the Kohinoor to.

1326
01:42:26,766 --> 01:42:28,234
Who?

1327
01:42:28,309 --> 01:42:29,652
Hamid Gul.

1328
01:42:30,478 --> 01:42:31,400
Excuse me.

1329
01:42:31,395 --> 01:42:32,942
I'm looking for Mr. Hamid Gul.
- Yes, ma'am.

1330
01:42:33,814 --> 01:42:34,610
There he is, ma'am.

1331
01:42:34,690 --> 01:42:36,192
See, there's Hamid Gul.

1332
01:42:36,317 --> 01:42:37,318
Hold on.

1333
01:42:39,028 --> 01:42:42,749
Please just...leave
this to me, okay?

1334
01:42:43,324 --> 01:42:44,701
You're jealous.

1335
01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:46,918
You're jealous because
I'm better than you.

1336
01:42:47,203 --> 01:42:49,297
And you didn't want
to bring me here.

1337
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:52,166
Beginner's luck.

1338
01:42:52,917 --> 01:42:57,923
Now Agent 000...let's try our luck.

1339
01:42:59,924 --> 01:43:00,891
14 Red.

1340
01:43:00,966 --> 01:43:02,968
Wow! That's a lot of money.

1341
01:43:03,844 --> 01:43:05,391
Changing 50,000.

1342
01:43:09,350 --> 01:43:11,193
Place your bets
Ladies and Gentlemen.

1343
01:43:12,645 --> 01:43:13,862
I don't know how to play.

1344
01:43:14,772 --> 01:43:16,774
Bet everything on no. 31.

1345
01:43:16,982 --> 01:43:18,154
All of it?

1346
01:43:19,402 --> 01:43:20,403
All of it.

1347
01:43:25,157 --> 01:43:26,329
No more bets.

1348
01:43:33,124 --> 01:43:35,047
Winner is 31 black!
Congratulations!

1349
01:43:36,669 --> 01:43:39,047
We won!

1350
01:43:39,296 --> 01:43:40,422
Congratulations, sir.

1351
01:43:44,510 --> 01:43:45,602
Now?

1352
01:43:45,678 --> 01:43:47,180
Place your bets.

1353
01:43:47,388 --> 01:43:48,640
26.

1354
01:43:49,056 --> 01:43:50,353
Okay-

1355
01:43:56,439 --> 01:43:57,941
The winner is 26 black.

1356
01:43:58,441 --> 01:44:00,694
We won!

1357
01:44:02,319 --> 01:44:04,117
Can I just take this one?

1358
01:44:04,321 --> 01:44:05,368
Thank you.

1359
01:44:06,282 --> 01:44:07,499
Here you go, sir. Congratulations.

1360
01:44:07,616 --> 01:44:11,621
That's enough.
We've won enough, let's go.

1361
01:44:11,704 --> 01:44:12,705
17.

1362
01:44:15,082 --> 01:44:16,083
No!

1363
01:44:16,709 --> 01:44:17,631
No.17.

1364
01:44:17,710 --> 01:44:18,757
Are you sure?

1365
01:44:20,588 --> 01:44:21,430
Okay-

1366
01:44:21,505 --> 01:44:22,506
17!

1367
01:44:24,759 --> 01:44:26,011
- No more bets.

1368
01:44:28,471 --> 01:44:30,189
And the winner is 7 red.

1369
01:44:30,347 --> 01:44:31,894
Oh yeah!

1370
01:44:31,974 --> 01:44:32,975
No!

1371
01:44:35,644 --> 01:44:37,237
That confirms it.

1372
01:44:37,313 --> 01:44:38,815
17 means danger.

1373
01:44:38,898 --> 01:44:40,445
Then why did you say 17?

1374
01:44:40,858 --> 01:44:42,405
A minute ago I was rich.

1375
01:44:42,485 --> 01:44:44,704
A minute ago, you didn't
know how to play roulette.

1376
01:44:45,112 --> 01:44:46,659
I should never
have listened to you.

1377
01:44:46,739 --> 01:44:47,740
Yeah!

1378
01:44:47,823 --> 01:44:49,040
Everything was fine
when you were winning.

1379
01:44:49,116 --> 01:44:50,493
You were hugging and kissing me.

1380
01:44:50,743 --> 01:44:52,245
You girls are all the same.

1381
01:44:52,495 --> 01:44:53,621
How dare you?

1382
01:44:54,038 --> 01:44:55,631
Perfect.
- What?

1383
01:44:55,790 --> 01:44:57,167
Hit me.
- No.

1384
01:44:57,249 --> 01:44:59,422
Just hit me.
- I'm sorry.

1385
01:44:59,502 --> 01:45:01,254
I can't slap anyone
without a reason.

1386
01:45:01,337 --> 01:45:03,806
You can't slap,
you can't kiss, what can you do?

1387
01:45:03,881 --> 01:45:05,053
Beg for romance over the internet?

1388
01:45:05,132 --> 01:45:06,554
Ooh! Bank receptionist!

1389
01:45:08,385 --> 01:45:09,386
Good. Very good!

1390
01:45:11,138 --> 01:45:12,731
Good.
Now go to the bathroom.

1391
01:45:12,807 --> 01:45:13,683
And when he comes there..

1392
01:45:13,766 --> 01:45:15,234
...tell him you will
meet him in <i>5</i> minutes.

1393
01:45:15,309 --> 01:45:16,902
Alone.
Go, go, go.

1394
01:45:19,897 --> 01:45:20,944
Go to hell.

1395
01:45:26,654 --> 01:45:28,201
Excuse me. I'll be back.

1396
01:45:37,164 --> 01:45:39,838
Unfortunate are those people...

1397
01:45:41,544 --> 01:45:43,046
...who do not know the worth..

1398
01:45:43,128 --> 01:45:45,347
...of a diamond they own.

1399
01:45:49,552 --> 01:45:52,180
Not a diamond but the Kohinoor.

1400
01:45:53,764 --> 01:45:55,186
The Kohinoor!

1401
01:45:55,558 --> 01:45:56,980
The Kohinoor can't be stolen.

1402
01:45:57,810 --> 01:45:59,562
That depends on the thief.

1403
01:46:01,438 --> 01:46:02,439
Hamid Gul.

1404
01:46:04,191 --> 01:46:05,613
And the thief's intentions?

1405
01:46:05,943 --> 01:46:06,944
Stealing.

1406
01:46:07,528 --> 01:46:08,700
The Kohinoor's desire?

1407
01:46:10,656 --> 01:46:12,158
Some fresh air.

1408
01:46:13,659 --> 01:46:15,661
In 15 minutes,
two glasses of champagne..

1409
01:46:15,744 --> 01:46:18,372
...and a thief will be
waiting for you on the terrace.

1410
01:46:19,665 --> 01:46:20,666
5 minutes.

1411
01:46:21,333 --> 01:46:23,802
Or someone may steal the Kohinoor.

1412
01:46:28,424 --> 01:46:29,676
Nice.

1413
01:46:35,472 --> 01:46:36,473
Well done!

1414
01:46:37,933 --> 01:46:39,310
Now go back to the hotel.

1415
01:46:39,727 --> 01:46:41,104
I'll meet you there.

1416
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:46,484
And after this...you...me.

1417
01:46:48,068 --> 01:46:50,366
I mean...we..

1418
01:46:51,947 --> 01:46:53,949
You know you're completely crazy.

1419
01:46:57,703 --> 01:46:59,205
I'll be waiting.

1420
01:47:25,105 --> 01:47:26,698
Whiskey on the rocks, huh!

1421
01:47:30,486 --> 01:47:32,284
Greetings, Hamid Gul.

1422
01:47:37,451 --> 01:47:39,124
How did you find me?

1423
01:47:39,662 --> 01:47:41,960
I stole the Kohinoor dude,
show me some respect.

1424
01:47:42,831 --> 01:47:44,378
But if you really want to know...

1425
01:47:44,458 --> 01:47:46,802
...your man Robert gave me
your address.

1426
01:47:48,921 --> 01:47:50,093
Just the address.

1427
01:47:52,549 --> 01:47:53,971
But the modus
operandi was all mine.

1428
01:47:55,844 --> 01:47:58,518
You're a thief...
but not a very smart thief.

1429
01:47:58,973 --> 01:48:00,941
You were never going
to be paid anyway.

1430
01:48:01,308 --> 01:48:04,107
But now you'll lose
the diamond and your life.

1431
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:07,069
If it was about the money why
would I sell the Kohinoor to you?

1432
01:48:08,315 --> 01:48:09,658
What do you really want?

1433
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:12,361
Omar Zafar.

1434
01:48:14,947 --> 01:48:16,824
So why the Kohinoor..

1435
01:48:17,616 --> 01:48:19,539
Who are you?

1436
01:48:42,891 --> 01:48:44,313
Where's Zafar?

1437
01:48:46,145 --> 01:48:47,146
Tell me!

1438
01:48:47,688 --> 01:48:48,689
Hey!

1439
01:48:53,527 --> 01:48:54,904
Tell me where Zafar is.

1440
01:48:55,070 --> 01:48:56,071
Tell me!

1441
01:48:57,489 --> 01:49:01,084
You'll never find him..

1442
01:49:04,413 --> 01:49:05,539
Hey you!!

1443
01:49:40,783 --> 01:49:44,162
Look, Rajveer only wants
to keep the Kohinoor safe.

1444
01:49:44,286 --> 01:49:46,334
The Kohinoor was safe in London.

1445
01:49:47,247 --> 01:49:49,170
Till he stole it.

1446
01:49:49,541 --> 01:49:51,919
It he hadn't,
someone else would have stolen it.

1447
01:49:52,002 --> 01:49:53,174
Oh really?

1448
01:49:53,670 --> 01:49:55,388
If it was that easy, then..

1449
01:49:55,464 --> 01:49:57,762
...why didn't anyone
steal it for 150 years?

1450
01:49:58,550 --> 01:50:00,723
What else did he tell you..

1451
01:50:01,053 --> 01:50:02,430
...which could be true?

1452
01:50:07,101 --> 01:50:09,024
He said that you will kill me.

1453
01:50:09,353 --> 01:50:10,855
But you're still alive.

1454
01:50:13,273 --> 01:50:14,820
Where's he right now?

1455
01:50:16,777 --> 01:50:18,324
He's with someone
called Hamid Gul.

1456
01:50:18,403 --> 01:50:20,201
Hamid Gul is dead.

1457
01:50:21,490 --> 01:50:22,491
He's dead.

1458
01:50:24,326 --> 01:50:27,956
Internal Secret Service
Chief, Mr. Narayanan.

1459
01:50:34,336 --> 01:50:35,713
"Kohinoor's desire."

1460
01:50:36,505 --> 01:50:37,927
"Open air."

1461
01:50:38,924 --> 01:50:41,518
"In 15 minutes,
two glasses of champagne.."

1462
01:50:41,593 --> 01:50:44,016
"..and a thief will be
waiting for you on the terrace."

1463
01:50:44,930 --> 01:50:46,147
"5 minutes."

1464
01:50:46,223 --> 01:50:49,727
And we found his body
on that same terrace.

1465
01:50:51,478 --> 01:50:53,196
Do you know what this means?

1466
01:50:57,484 --> 01:51:01,239
Ms. Harleen, you're an
international criminal now.

1467
01:51:02,573 --> 01:51:04,996
Killing you will be easy for us.

1468
01:51:05,617 --> 01:51:07,665
But we know the truth.

1469
01:51:07,995 --> 01:51:09,497
Ms. Harleen...

1470
01:51:10,789 --> 01:51:14,168
You have an opportunity..

1471
01:51:14,251 --> 01:51:16,128
...to get your life back.

1472
01:51:16,962 --> 01:51:19,181
To go back to your grandma.

1473
01:51:20,090 --> 01:51:23,685
And that opportunity
is sealed in this transmitter.

1474
01:51:35,230 --> 01:51:37,358
'You're an international
criminal now.'

1475
01:51:39,818 --> 01:51:41,035
'I trust you.'

1476
01:51:43,780 --> 01:51:46,533
'What else did he tell you,
which could be true?'

1477
01:52:01,048 --> 01:52:02,595
Come with me.
We can't stay here now.

1478
01:52:02,841 --> 01:52:03,842
Let's go.

1479
01:52:14,603 --> 01:52:16,196
You left a long
while ago from there.

1480
01:52:16,647 --> 01:52:17,819
Where were you?

1481
01:52:18,440 --> 01:52:21,114
Do you want the truth
or should I lie like you.

1482
01:52:22,819 --> 01:52:24,196
What did I lie about?

1483
01:52:24,947 --> 01:52:26,665
You lied about everything.

1484
01:52:26,865 --> 01:52:29,618
About you. About us.

1485
01:52:30,244 --> 01:52:31,962
About Hamid Gul.

1486
01:52:33,038 --> 01:52:34,631
You killed him, didn't you?

1487
01:52:36,291 --> 01:52:37,508
Who told you that?

1488
01:52:37,668 --> 01:52:38,669
<i>Zorawar.</i>

1489
01:52:45,175 --> 01:52:47,177
So you still have the Kohinoor...

1490
01:53:29,594 --> 01:53:31,562
Why did you pretend
to be Vickie that day?

1491
01:53:35,100 --> 01:53:36,977
You should have left me alone.

1492
01:53:40,063 --> 01:53:42,157
Why did you let me
live out my dreams..

1493
01:53:43,275 --> 01:53:44,527
...and show me new ones?

1494
01:53:47,070 --> 01:53:48,617
I will fulfill all of them.

1495
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:53,201
Trust me.

1496
01:53:55,662 --> 01:53:56,663
Enough!

1497
01:53:58,290 --> 01:53:59,507
I don't want to anymore.

1498
01:54:04,296 --> 01:54:05,718
Then what are you waiting for?

1499
01:54:17,059 --> 01:54:18,652
- Stay. Don't move!

1500
01:54:18,769 --> 01:54:20,066
- Hands in the air!

1501
01:54:20,312 --> 01:54:21,279
- Now!

1502
01:54:22,773 --> 01:54:24,116
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

1503
01:54:31,448 --> 01:54:32,449
- Rajveer!

1504
01:54:50,175 --> 01:54:52,303
If the bullet doesn't kill him,
he'll definitely drown to death.

1505
01:54:57,349 --> 01:54:59,272
You've got your life back.

1506
01:55:02,396 --> 01:55:03,363
Go on.

1507
01:56:14,968 --> 01:56:18,723
Thank God,
you're back home safe and sound.

1508
01:56:19,514 --> 01:56:22,734
This house doesn't
feel the same without you.

1509
01:56:27,606 --> 01:56:30,576
"After it's all
over home sweet home."

1510
01:56:31,526 --> 01:56:32,869
"Which school did you go to?"

1511
01:56:32,944 --> 01:56:34,241
"Dehradun Public School."

1512
01:57:16,029 --> 01:57:17,030
Hey!

1513
01:57:18,198 --> 01:57:19,575
What are you looking for?

1514
01:57:19,658 --> 01:57:22,081
Actually sir, I..
- Pankaj...

1515
01:57:22,285 --> 01:57:23,036
Excuse me.

1516
01:57:23,119 --> 01:57:24,041
What are you doing?

1517
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:25,838
She was snooping
around like a thief..

1518
01:57:25,956 --> 01:57:27,424
...and you're questioning me?

1519
01:57:27,499 --> 01:57:31,800
No, sir...you ordered
these books on the internet.

1520
01:57:32,170 --> 01:57:33,797
I didn't order any books.

1521
01:57:35,382 --> 01:57:37,931
Oh, Pankaj.
You never remember anything.

1522
01:57:38,176 --> 01:57:39,598
Now put that stupid gun inside.

1523
01:57:39,844 --> 01:57:41,312
Come in my clear.

1524
01:57:41,930 --> 01:57:42,931
Come.

1525
01:57:47,686 --> 01:57:49,404
You have a lovely home.

1526
01:57:54,067 --> 01:57:55,910
How long have you been living here?

1527
01:57:56,278 --> 01:57:57,825
In this house?

1528
01:57:58,196 --> 01:57:59,243
Can't remember.

1529
01:57:59,322 --> 01:58:01,871
Pankaj? Must be 40 years, right?

1530
01:58:02,742 --> 01:58:03,618
Thank you.

1531
01:58:03,702 --> 01:58:05,500
For as long as we've been married.

1532
01:58:05,579 --> 01:58:06,956
It's beautiful.

1533
01:58:07,038 --> 01:58:09,006
Everything seems so new.

1534
01:58:09,207 --> 01:58:12,086
Yeah, when Pankaj won the
lottery for the second time..

1535
01:58:12,252 --> 01:58:14,380
You won the lottery twice?

1536
01:58:16,089 --> 01:58:17,636
Yeah! He's really lucky.

1537
01:58:17,841 --> 01:58:19,138
Right, Pankaj?

1538
01:58:20,093 --> 01:58:21,561
So lucky that"

1539
01:58:21,553 --> 01:58:23,521
Yes. I know.

1540
01:58:24,472 --> 01:58:27,316
He'll say he doesn't remember
when he bought a lottery ticket.

1541
01:58:27,601 --> 01:58:28,568
Like he doesn't remember..

1542
01:58:28,643 --> 01:58:30,645
...when he took part
in the bank's lucky draw.

1543
01:58:30,729 --> 01:58:32,197
And...he also doesn't remember..

1544
01:58:32,272 --> 01:58:34,525
...when he ordered these
books on the internet?

1545
01:58:34,733 --> 01:58:36,201
Let me get some tea.

1546
01:58:39,988 --> 01:58:41,080
Sir...

1547
01:58:41,865 --> 01:58:44,038
...this is Rajveer's
hideout, right?

1548
01:58:46,328 --> 01:58:47,329
Excuse me?

1549
01:58:48,580 --> 01:58:49,752
What do you mean?

1550
01:58:52,083 --> 01:58:53,551
What's going on?

1551
01:58:54,294 --> 01:58:57,594
Nothing... I was just...

1552
01:58:59,049 --> 01:59:00,141
I should be leaving...

1553
01:59:16,524 --> 01:59:17,616
Our sons.

1554
01:59:19,861 --> 01:59:20,862
Our brave sons.

1555
01:59:24,282 --> 01:59:25,283
This is Viren.

1556
01:59:26,785 --> 01:59:28,412
Died in the line of duty.

1557
01:59:29,079 --> 01:59:31,252
And he...he's Jai.

1558
01:59:33,625 --> 01:59:35,047
He was in the army too.

1559
01:59:36,252 --> 01:59:39,677
Or maybe he is still in the army.
I don't know.

1560
01:59:40,465 --> 01:59:42,433
He was posted in Kargil...

1561
01:59:42,509 --> 01:59:44,182
...when he heard about Viren.

1562
01:59:44,678 --> 01:59:45,975
And since then...

1563
01:59:46,262 --> 01:59:48,731
...they say that he
was on a mission and...

1564
01:59:50,183 --> 01:59:53,653
...the lake was really deep and..

1565
01:59:53,812 --> 01:59:54,984
He's absolutely fine.

1566
01:59:56,439 --> 01:59:57,861
No matter what people say.

1567
02:00:05,907 --> 02:00:07,329
He won this trophy in...

1568
02:00:07,951 --> 02:00:10,170
...the state swimming championship.

1569
02:00:11,496 --> 02:00:12,793
He was the only one...

1570
02:00:13,373 --> 02:00:16,217
...who could swim across
the lake in one breath.

1571
02:00:17,001 --> 02:00:19,095
I refuse to believe he's dead.

1572
02:00:40,233 --> 02:00:41,234
- Hello!

1573
02:00:41,735 --> 02:00:43,032
- Hello!

1574
02:00:43,403 --> 02:00:44,700
Anybody there!

1575
02:00:49,576 --> 02:00:50,577
- Harleen.

1576
02:00:52,078 --> 02:00:54,581
Excuse me. Who are you?

1577
02:00:55,206 --> 02:00:57,174
- I'll ask the questions, not you.

1578
02:00:59,252 --> 02:01:00,595
- Where's the Kohinoor?

1579
02:01:00,795 --> 02:01:03,423
I don't know, please let me go.

1580
02:01:07,886 --> 02:01:08,887
Zafar.

1581
02:01:09,596 --> 02:01:11,018
I am Omar Zafar.

1582
02:01:21,316 --> 02:01:23,068
How did you get this?

1583
02:01:23,401 --> 02:01:25,153
Not how, but why did I get this?

1584
02:01:26,196 --> 02:01:27,618
Why do I have it?

1585
02:01:30,283 --> 02:01:32,502
If you didn't want it,
why steal it in the first place?

1586
02:01:33,286 --> 02:01:35,084
Where's the real Kohinoor?

1587
02:01:36,122 --> 02:01:37,499
That was a fake?

1588
02:01:37,665 --> 02:01:41,169
The real one would've
shattered the hammer.

1589
02:01:43,963 --> 02:01:45,886
She spent a lot
of time with Rajveer.

1590
02:01:46,633 --> 02:01:47,634
Baktawar?

1591
02:01:47,717 --> 02:01:48,809
<i>Zorawar.</i>

1592
02:01:48,885 --> 02:01:50,637
So she won't tell us so easily.

1593
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:52,097
You're with him?

1594
02:01:53,348 --> 02:01:55,771
I gave him the Kohinoor I had.

1595
02:01:56,142 --> 02:01:58,190
I don't know where the real one is.

1596
02:01:59,395 --> 02:02:02,740
Quiet! Or else...

1597
02:02:02,941 --> 02:02:04,158
Get it?

1598
02:02:05,276 --> 02:02:06,277
Yes.

1599
02:02:06,569 --> 02:02:07,912
That's like a good girl.

1600
02:02:14,786 --> 02:02:15,787
Ow!

1601
02:02:18,998 --> 02:02:22,423
No more wisecracks from you.

1602
02:02:31,094 --> 02:02:34,394
Now you'll only speak the truth,
and nothing but the truth.

1603
02:02:34,889 --> 02:02:35,936
Tell me.

1604
02:02:36,766 --> 02:02:38,643
Tell you what?
- The truth.

1605
02:02:40,270 --> 02:02:43,069
Honestly speaking, Mr. Bhatnagan.
- Zorawar!

1606
02:02:44,232 --> 02:02:45,984
With that mustache ..

1607
02:02:46,317 --> 02:02:48,285
...you look like
a south-Indian hero.

1608
02:02:48,486 --> 02:02:49,703
What?
- Yes.

1609
02:02:52,365 --> 02:02:54,868
And you know, my grandma's life..

1610
02:02:54,951 --> 02:02:56,669
...Is more exciting than mine.

1611
02:02:56,744 --> 02:02:57,745
Quiet!

1612
02:02:58,872 --> 02:03:01,091
Just tell us where the Kohinoor is.

1613
02:03:01,708 --> 02:03:02,834
Kohinoor.

1614
02:03:10,842 --> 02:03:12,890
Rajveer has the Kohinoor.

1615
02:03:14,470 --> 02:03:15,972
But Rajveer is dead.

1616
02:03:18,725 --> 02:03:20,773
No...he's alive!

1617
02:03:33,489 --> 02:03:35,162
He planned all of this.

1618
02:03:51,382 --> 02:03:53,726
He wants me to think
that he's dead..

1619
02:03:54,177 --> 02:03:56,100
...so that you think he's not alive.

1620
02:04:02,226 --> 02:04:05,196
But he doesn't know,
that I know he's alive.

1621
02:04:05,438 --> 02:04:07,861
He thinks that I think he's dead.

1622
02:04:08,399 --> 02:04:10,072
Understand Mr. Zindagi Ek Safar?

1623
02:04:15,865 --> 02:04:19,836
If he's alive,
I'll be absolutely fine.

1624
02:04:25,917 --> 02:04:28,045
You two are such fools.

1625
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:31,548
That day on the bridge,
he pressed the transmitter himself.

1626
02:04:37,053 --> 02:04:38,600
He could've escaped.

1627
02:04:38,930 --> 02:04:41,274
But he intentionally
gave me the fake Kohinoor.

1628
02:04:53,569 --> 02:04:55,492
So that you would bring me here...

1629
02:04:55,571 --> 02:04:57,619
...and he could come after you.

1630
02:05:23,224 --> 02:05:24,942
Rajveer, hi.

1631
02:05:25,143 --> 02:05:26,440
Not bad, Harleen.

1632
02:05:26,936 --> 02:05:29,485
You turned out to be a
lot smarter than these fools.

1633
02:05:39,365 --> 02:05:45,839
I can't imagine the wit,
courage and obsession...

1634
02:05:46,289 --> 02:05:48,087
...one needs to get here.

1635
02:05:48,291 --> 02:05:50,419
Not as much as you think.

1636
02:05:53,046 --> 02:05:58,018
Luckily, neither you
nor your men are too smart.

1637
02:06:04,640 --> 02:06:09,271
Who's smart and who isn't
won't be decided <i>so</i> fast Rajveer.

1638
02:06:13,524 --> 02:06:18,155
That will be decided,
when one of us is dead..

1639
02:06:18,404 --> 02:06:20,156
...and the other
one has the Kohinoor.

1640
02:06:36,005 --> 02:06:37,427
The question now is...

1641
02:06:37,965 --> 02:06:39,842
...how much pain can you endure...

1642
02:06:40,384 --> 02:06:42,057
...before handing
over the Kohinoor.

1643
02:06:46,099 --> 02:06:48,352
Tell me...where is the Kohinoor?

1644
02:06:49,060 --> 02:06:52,610
Otherwise, it'll be Harleen's
turn to endure the pain.

1645
02:06:53,397 --> 02:06:54,569
Tell me!

1646
02:06:55,441 --> 02:06:58,115
The Kohinoor is where it should be.

1647
02:07:00,905 --> 02:07:01,997
In London.

1648
02:07:02,949 --> 02:07:04,075
You're lying.

1649
02:07:05,076 --> 02:07:07,829
The Kohinoor has been stolen,
everyone knows that.

1650
02:07:08,162 --> 02:07:10,415
Because we said it's been stolen.

1651
02:07:12,125 --> 02:07:13,342
What do you mean?

1652
02:07:13,668 --> 02:07:15,136
This was a joint operation...

1653
02:07:15,211 --> 02:07:17,464
...of the Indian Secret
Service and London's MI6.

1654
02:07:19,006 --> 02:07:21,384
When you asked for the Kohinoor...

1655
02:07:22,426 --> 02:07:23,894
we made our plan.

1656
02:07:26,597 --> 02:07:28,770
The Kohinoor is
safe in its place, Zafar.

1657
02:07:32,770 --> 02:07:37,321
But unfortunately, you are not.

1658
02:07:38,276 --> 02:07:41,576
You mean... the Kohinoor
was never stolen.

1659
02:07:45,908 --> 02:07:47,831
Brilliant, Rajveer.

1660
02:07:48,202 --> 02:07:49,203
Brilliant!

1661
02:07:50,746 --> 02:07:54,751
Not everyone is fortunate enough to
hear their eulogy before dying...

1662
02:07:55,793 --> 02:07:57,136
but, what's the point?

1663
02:07:59,297 --> 02:08:01,174
How will you save yourself now?

1664
02:08:02,175 --> 02:08:05,725
Because the countdown to
your death has already begun.

1665
02:08:06,179 --> 02:08:07,601
Those who serve their country...

1666
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:10,604
start the countdown to their death
from their very first breath, Zafar.

1667
02:08:14,478 --> 02:08:16,196
Take a good look in these eyes.

1668
02:08:17,315 --> 02:08:19,113
There's no grief...

1669
02:08:20,109 --> 02:08:21,531
...or fear of death.

1670
02:08:24,405 --> 02:08:25,998
There's only pride.

1671
02:08:27,617 --> 02:08:32,123
"Soon... you'll see your
death in similar eyes."

1672
02:08:33,915 --> 02:08:35,041
Remember anything?

1673
02:08:37,585 --> 02:08:38,837
Colonel Nanda.

1674
02:08:39,962 --> 02:08:41,635
How are you related to him?

1675
02:08:45,676 --> 02:08:47,053
I am his brother.

1676
02:08:49,931 --> 02:08:52,684
The countdown to your
death started that day, Zafar.

1677
02:08:54,268 --> 02:08:56,896
And it ends...today.

1678
02:08:59,148 --> 02:09:00,149
10!

1679
02:09:05,655 --> 02:09:06,656
9!

1680
02:09:09,575 --> 02:09:10,576
B!

1681
02:09:13,079 --> 02:09:14,422
Go out and see what's happening.

1682
02:09:14,413 --> 02:09:15,539
7!

1683
02:09:16,916 --> 02:09:18,088
B!

1684
02:09:19,210 --> 02:09:20,211
S!

1685
02:09:21,504 --> 02:09:22,505
He's not alone.

1686
02:09:22,588 --> 02:09:24,181
Who else is with you?

1687
02:09:24,257 --> 02:09:25,258
4!

1688
02:09:27,843 --> 02:09:28,890
3!

1689
02:09:30,179 --> 02:09:31,806
You won't get out alive either.

1690
02:09:32,265 --> 02:09:33,266
2!

1691
02:09:33,349 --> 02:09:35,101
You'll die just like your brother.

1692
02:09:35,977 --> 02:09:36,978
1!

1693
02:09:49,115 --> 02:09:50,116
Bang-Bang!

1694
02:10:13,889 --> 02:10:16,062
They injected me because of you.

1695
02:10:20,479 --> 02:10:21,856
That injection won't kill you.

1696
02:10:21,981 --> 02:10:23,699
You'll just speak the truth,
that's all.

1697
02:10:23,774 --> 02:10:24,775
Okay? Let's go.

1698
02:10:32,450 --> 02:10:34,953
The truth is I wasted
my entire life.

1699
02:10:36,329 --> 02:10:37,751
They're shooting at us. Let's go.

1700
02:10:39,290 --> 02:10:40,587
All those boys...

1701
02:10:40,833 --> 02:10:44,463
Dilip, Jaggi, Harbhajan
they were all the same.

1702
02:10:44,962 --> 02:10:46,305
Boring. Boring. Boring.

1703
02:10:46,380 --> 02:10:47,381
Duck!

1704
02:10:51,010 --> 02:10:52,353
But not you.

1705
02:10:52,678 --> 02:10:54,555
You're very exciting.

1706
02:10:55,389 --> 02:10:56,390
Jump!

1707
02:11:02,021 --> 02:11:03,694
You really excite me.

1708
02:11:04,148 --> 02:11:05,149
Good.

1709
02:11:05,274 --> 02:11:06,821
That's good.
Shall we go now?

1710
02:11:18,704 --> 02:11:22,504
Your muscles are so strong.

1711
02:11:22,666 --> 02:11:24,543
I want to tear your clothes off.

1712
02:11:25,294 --> 02:11:26,796
But I can't...

1713
02:11:27,463 --> 02:11:29,807
...because I am
not exciting enough.

1714
02:11:30,049 --> 02:11:31,972
Harleen!
We have to go.

1715
02:11:37,765 --> 02:11:39,392
Do I look sexy to you?

1716
02:11:39,725 --> 02:11:40,772
A lot.

1717
02:11:42,061 --> 02:11:43,779
Then why didn't you do something?

1718
02:11:44,021 --> 02:11:45,022
What?

1719
02:11:45,022 --> 02:11:46,740
Why didn't you do something?

1720
02:11:47,650 --> 02:11:49,527
Thank God you won't
remember anything.

1721
02:11:49,860 --> 02:11:51,783
I will remember everything.

1722
02:11:52,154 --> 02:11:54,953
The truth is you don't love me.

1723
02:11:55,658 --> 02:11:57,285
You find me boring.

1724
02:11:58,619 --> 02:11:59,620
Rajveer.

1725
02:12:01,205 --> 02:12:03,458
Harleen, get on the bike.
Come on, hurry up!

1726
02:12:33,571 --> 02:12:35,244
Soon we'll part ways...

1727
02:12:35,739 --> 02:12:37,582
...you'll go on to live
your exciting life...

1728
02:12:37,783 --> 02:12:39,626
...and me, my boring life.

1729
02:12:44,415 --> 02:12:46,543
Why would you be
with a boring girl?

1730
02:12:47,835 --> 02:12:49,212
You're not boring, Harleen.

1731
02:12:49,378 --> 02:12:50,470
Then what am I?

1732
02:12:54,008 --> 02:12:55,009
Tell me.

1733
02:12:55,551 --> 02:12:56,643
What am...

1734
02:12:58,179 --> 02:13:01,683
You're sexy, exciting,
crazy and right now...alive.

1735
02:13:02,224 --> 02:13:03,567
Let's keep it that way, okay!

1736
02:13:04,935 --> 02:13:05,936
Unzip me.

1737
02:13:09,523 --> 02:13:10,149
Now?

1738
02:13:10,232 --> 02:13:11,233
Hug me.

1739
02:13:15,488 --> 02:13:16,740
Did you find my guns?

1740
02:13:19,700 --> 02:13:21,498
You're very exciting, Harleen.

1741
02:13:21,494 --> 02:13:23,667
Now take the guns out and shoot!

1742
02:14:28,561 --> 02:14:29,562
- Rajveer!

1743
02:14:30,062 --> 02:14:31,154
Enough.
- Come here.

1744
02:14:31,230 --> 02:14:32,402
Rajveer.
- Get up!

1745
02:14:34,024 --> 02:14:35,867
Shoaib died because of him.

1746
02:14:36,527 --> 02:14:39,030
He killed Hamid Gul
and took the Kohinoor.

1747
02:14:39,113 --> 02:14:40,706
Here's the Kohinoor.

1748
02:14:42,074 --> 02:14:43,872
If you can get to me, then...

1749
02:14:44,285 --> 02:14:46,379
...you can get the
real Kohinoor as well.

1750
02:14:47,162 --> 02:14:48,539
When you have the real Kohinoor...

1751
02:14:48,622 --> 02:14:50,920
...you can come and
exchange it for her.

1752
02:14:57,798 --> 02:15:00,642
I am sure you will find me...again.

1753
02:15:01,719 --> 02:15:02,811
Goodbye.

1754
02:15:03,429 --> 02:15:04,146
Come on.

1755
02:15:04,221 --> 02:15:05,473
Take this.
- Rajveer.

1756
02:15:07,725 --> 02:15:08,726
- Rajveer.

1757
02:16:22,091 --> 02:16:23,092
Help!

1758
02:17:03,966 --> 02:17:04,933
Help!

1759
02:17:05,008 --> 02:17:06,305
Somebody.
- Hey!

1760
02:17:08,804 --> 02:17:11,307
The next bullet will hit your face,
if you're not quiet.

1761
02:17:46,425 --> 02:17:48,348
Oh my God! Oh my God!

1762
02:18:10,783 --> 02:18:13,036
And listen,
I want the Kohinoor at any cost.

1763
02:19:23,272 --> 02:19:24,319
Oh my God!

1764
02:19:24,398 --> 02:19:26,696
The plane has been hit!
- David, check what's happening.

1765
02:19:26,775 --> 02:19:28,402
- We have to land the plane!

1766
02:20:41,892 --> 02:20:42,893
Rajveer.

1767
02:20:44,186 --> 02:20:45,187
- Rajveer.

1768
02:20:46,855 --> 02:20:48,198
Rajveer.

1769
02:23:24,221 --> 02:23:25,222
Well done.

1770
02:23:26,139 --> 02:23:27,391
Thank you, sir.

1771
02:23:29,101 --> 02:23:31,229
Your parents have
led a strange life.

1772
02:23:32,938 --> 02:23:35,908
One son sacrificed
his life for his country.

1773
02:23:37,400 --> 02:23:40,654
And the other is dead for them,
even though he's alive.

1774
02:23:44,491 --> 02:23:46,414
Harleen has been sent home.

1775
02:23:47,786 --> 02:23:49,333
And she has been instructed...

1776
02:23:50,413 --> 02:23:52,165
not to meet you again.

1777
02:23:53,750 --> 02:23:57,755
You know, that Jai is "dead"
for the sake of this mission.

1778
02:23:58,130 --> 02:23:59,928
Now you are Rajveer.

1779
02:24:01,758 --> 02:24:04,102
By joining the Internal
Secret Services..

1780
02:24:04,177 --> 02:24:06,646
...you've signed
over your life to us.

1781
02:24:07,722 --> 02:24:10,316
Harleen can prove
to be a threat for you.

1782
02:24:11,226 --> 02:24:13,228
She could be your weakness.

1783
02:24:14,938 --> 02:24:18,568
Anyway, you'll be transported
to a safe place tomorrow.

1784
02:24:27,159 --> 02:24:29,332
Till then...get some rest.

1785
02:24:54,769 --> 02:24:56,021
What did I just have?

1786
02:25:02,277 --> 02:25:03,449
Harleen!

1787
02:25:26,218 --> 02:25:28,141
Stop! Stop the car!

1788
02:25:31,806 --> 02:25:34,776
Don't worry, Rajveer,
we're safe.

1789
02:25:42,400 --> 02:25:43,401
Good morning.

1790
02:26:07,717 --> 02:26:08,764
Where are we?

1791
02:26:11,096 --> 02:26:13,315
Who changed my clothes?

1792
02:26:14,933 --> 02:26:17,482
You ask too many questions.

1793
02:26:18,603 --> 02:26:19,604
I did.

1794
02:26:20,063 --> 02:26:23,283
And if I remember correctly,
my eyes were closed.

1795
02:26:25,819 --> 02:26:26,820
